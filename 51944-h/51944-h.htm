    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.&mdash;ON CERTAIN ABSTRACTIONS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> WAS talking about
      woman in the abstract,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other, whose name was Edmund&mdash;his worst enemies had never
      abbreviated it&mdash;smiled, lifted his eyes unto the hills as if in
      search of something, frowned as if he failed to find it, smiled a
      cat&rsquo;s-paw of a smile&mdash;a momentary crinkle in the region of the eyes&mdash;twice
      his lips parted as if he were about to speak; then he gave a laugh&mdash;the
      laugh of a man who finds that for which he has been searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman in the abstract?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Woman in the abstract? My dear Harold,
      there is no such thing as woman in the abstract. When you talk about Woman
      enthusiastically, you are talking about the woman you love; when you talk
      about Woman cynically, you are talking about the woman who won&rsquo;t love
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe your honours never heard tell of Larry O&rsquo;Leary?&rdquo; said the Third&mdash;for
      there was a Third, and his name was Brian; his duty was to row the boat,
      and this duty he interpreted by making now and again an elaborate pretence
      of rowing, which deceived no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds well,&rdquo; said Harold; &ldquo;but do you want it to be applied? Do you
      want a test case of the operation of your epigram&mdash;if it is an
      epigram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A test case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I have heard you talk cynically about woman upon occasions. Does
      that mean that you have been unloved by many?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the man called Edmund looked inquiringly up the purple slope of the
      hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonderful clever gentleman,&rdquo; said Brian, as if communing with
      himself, &ldquo;a wonderful gentleman entirely! Isn&rsquo;t he after casting his eyes
      at the very spot where old Larry kept his still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Edmund; &ldquo;I have never spoken cynically of women. To do so would
      be to speak against my convictions. I have great hope of Woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; our mothers and sisters are women,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;That makes us
      hopeful of women. Now we are back in the wholesome regions of the abstract
      once more, so that we have talked in a circle and are precisely where we
      started, only that I have heard for the first time that you are hopeful of
      Woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for one day,&rdquo; said Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know that in the old days the Excise police looked after the
      potheen&mdash;the Royal Irish does it now,&rdquo; said the Third. &ldquo;Well, as I
      say, in the old days there was a reward of five pounds given by the
      Excisemen for the discovery of a private still. Now Larry had been a
      regular hero at transforming the innocent smiling pratie into the drink
      that&rsquo;s the curse of the country, God bless it! But he was too wary a lad
      for the police, and he rolled keg after keg down the side of Slieve Gorm.
      At last the worm of his still got worn out&mdash;they do wear out after a
      dozen years or so of stiff work&mdash;and people noticed that Larry was
      wearing out too, just through thinking of where he&rsquo;d get the three pound
      ten to buy the new machinery. They tried to cheer him up, and the decent
      boys was so anxious to give him heart that there wasn&rsquo;t such a thing as a
      sober man to be found in all the country side. But though the brave
      fellows did what they could for him, it was no use. He never got within
      three pound five of the three pound ten that he needed. But just as things
      was at their worst, they mended. Larry was his old self again, and the
      word went round that the boys might get sober by degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what did our friend Larry do, if you please, but take his old
      worn-out still and hide it among the heather of the hill fornenst us&mdash;Slieve
      Glas is its name&mdash;and then he goes the same night to the Excise
      officer, in the queer secret way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m in a bad way for money, or it&rsquo;s not me that would be after turning
      informer,&rsquo; says he, when he had told the officer that he knew where the
      still was concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of you all,&rsquo; says the officer. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll not inform on
      principle, but only because you&rsquo;re in need of money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;More&rsquo;s the pity, sir,&rsquo; says Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the still?&rsquo; says the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If I bring you to it,&rsquo; says Larry, &lsquo;it must be kept a dead secret, for
      the owner is the best friend I have in the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a nice chap to inform on your best friend,&rsquo; says the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never be able to look at him straight in the face after, and that&rsquo;s
      the truth,&rsquo; says Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your honours, didn&rsquo;t Larry lead the officer and a couple of the
      Excisemen up the hill in the dark of the early morning, and sure enough
      they came upon the old still, hid among the heather. It was captured, and
      Larry got the five pound reward, and was able to buy a brand-new still
      with the money, besides having thirty shillings to the good in his pocket.
      After that, was it any wonder that he became one of the greatest informers
      in the country? By the Powers, he made a neat thing out of the business of
      leading the officers to his own stills and pocketing the reward. He was
      thirty shillings to the good every time. Ah, Larry was a boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I judge,&rdquo; said the man called Edmund, with an unaffected laugh&mdash;he
      had studied the art of being unaffected. &ldquo;But you see, it was not of the
      Man but of the Woman we were talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I thought that the change would be good for your honours,&rdquo;
       remarked Brian. &ldquo;When gentlemen that I&rsquo;ve out in this boat with me, begin
      to talk together in a way that has got no sense in it at all, I know that
      they&rsquo;re talking about a woman, and I tell them the story of Larry
      O&rsquo;Leary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither the man called Edmund, nor the man called Harold, talked any more
      that day upon Woman as a topic.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;ON A GREAT HOPE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> THINK you
      remarked that you had great hope of Woman,&rdquo; said Harold, the next day. The
      boat had drifted once again into the centre of the same scene, and there
      seemed to be a likelihood of at least two of the boat&rsquo;s company drifting
      back to the topic of the previous afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you certainly admitted that you had great hope of Woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I have. Woman felt, long ago; she is beginning to feel again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that feeling is being educated out of her? I certainly
      have occasional suspicions that this process is going on. Why, just think
      of the Stafford girl. She can tell you at a moment&rsquo;s notice the exact
      difference between an atheist, an infidel, an agnostic, a freethinker, and
      the Honest Doubter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been reading modern fiction&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. No, I don&rsquo;t think
      that what is called education makes much difference to a woman. After all,
      what does this thing called education mean? It simply means that a girl
      can read all the objectionable passages of the ancient poets without the
      need of a translation. I have hope of Woman because she is frequently so
      intensely feminine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you never heard tell of how the Widdy MacDermott&rsquo;s cabin came to be
      a ruin,&rdquo; said the Third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feeling and femininity will, shall I say, transform woman into our
      ideal?&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Transform is too strong a word,&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;And as for our ideal,
      well, every woman is the ideal of some man for a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that truth shows not only how lowly is the ideal of some men, but
      also how unwise it is to attempt to speak of woman in the abstract. I
      begin to think that what you said yesterday had a grain of truth in it,
      though it was an epigram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Widdy MacDermott&mdash;oh, the Widdy Mac-Dermott,&rdquo; said the Third, as
      though repeating the burden of a ballad. &ldquo;They made a pome about her in
      Irish, that was near as full of nonsense as if it had been in the English.
      You see when Tim, her husband, went to glory he left the cow behind him,
      taking thought for the need of his widdy, though she hadn&rsquo;t been a widdy
      when he was acquainted with her. Well, your honours, the byre was a trifle
      too near the edge of the bog hole, so that when one end fell out, there
      wasn&rsquo;t much of the mud walls that stood. Then one blessed morning the
      childer came running into the cabin to tell their mother that the cow was
      sitting among the ruins of its home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Marius of the farmyard,&rdquo; remarked Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likely enough, sir. Anyhow, there she sat as melancholy as if she was a
      Christian. Of course, as the winter was well for&rsquo;ard it wouldn&rsquo;t do to
      risk her life by leaving her to wander about the bogs, so they drove her
      into the cabin&mdash;it was a tight fit for her, passing through the door&mdash;she
      could just get in and nothing to spare; but when she was inside it was
      warm and comfortable that the same cow made the cabin, and the childer
      were wondering at the end of a month how they could have been such fools
      as to shiver through the winter while the cow was outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In another month some fine spring days came, and the cabin was a bit
      close and stuffy with the cow inside, and the widdy herself turned the
      animal&rsquo;s head to the door and went to drive her out for exercise and
      ventilation. But the way the beast had been fed and petted told upon her,
      and by the Powers, if she didn&rsquo;t stick fast in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They leathered her in the cabin and they coaxed her from outside, but it
      was all of no use. The craythur stood jammed in the door, while the
      childer crawled in and out of the cabin among her hind legs&mdash;the fore
      legs was half a cow&rsquo;s length outside. That was the situation in the middle
      of the day, and all the neighbours was standing round giving advice, and
      calling in to the widdy herself&mdash;who, of course, was a prisoner in
      the cabin&mdash;not to lose heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not heart I&rsquo;m afeard of losing&mdash;it&rsquo;s the cow,&rsquo; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your honours, the evening was coming on, but no change in the
      situation of affairs took place, and the people of the country-side was
      getting used to the appearance of the half cow projecting beyond the door
      of the cabin, and to think that maybe, after all, it was nothing outside
      the ordinary course of events, when Barney M&rsquo;Bratney, who does the
      carpentering at the Castle, came up the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took in the situation with the glance of the perfessional man, and
      says he, &lsquo;By the Powers, its a case of the cow or the cabin. Which would
      ye rather be after losing, Widdy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The cabin by all means,&rsquo; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re right, my good woman,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Come outside with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your honours, the kindly neighbours hauled the widdy outside over
      the back of the cow, and then with a crowbar Barney attacked the walls on
      both sides of the door. In ten minutes the cow was free, but the cabin was
      a wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course his lardship built it up again stronger than it ever was, but
      as he wouldn&rsquo;t make the door wide enough to accommodate the cow&mdash;he
      offered to build a byre for her, but that wasn&rsquo;t the same&mdash;he has
      never been so respected as he was before in the neighbourhood of
      Ballyboreen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well as a story,&rdquo; said Edmund; &ldquo;but you see we were
      talking on the subject of the advantages of the higher education of
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True for you, sir,&rdquo; said Brian. &ldquo;And if the Widdy MacDermott had been
      born with eddication would she have let her childer to sleep with the
      cow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harold,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;there are many side lights upon the general
      question of the advantages of culture in women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the story of the Widdy MacDermott is one of them?&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I notice that gentlemen that come out in the boat with me begin to
      talk on contentious topics, I tell them the story of how the Widdy
      MacDermott&rsquo;s cabin was wrecked,&rdquo; said Brian.

      CHAPTER III.&mdash;ON HONESTY AND THE WORKING MAN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ON&rsquo;T you think,&rdquo;
       remarked Edmund, the next day, as the boat drifted under the great cliffs,
      and Brian was discharging with great ability his normal duty of resting on
      his oars. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that you should come to business without
      further delay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to business?&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Two days ago you lured me out in this coracle to make a
      communication to me that I judged would have some bearing upon your future
      course of life. You began talking of Woman with a touch of fervour in your
      voice. You assured me that you were referring only to woman in the
      abstract, and when I convinced you&mdash;I trust I convinced you&mdash;that
      woman in the abstract has no existence, you got frightened&mdash;as
      frightened as a child would be, if the thing that it has always regarded
      as a doll were to wink suddenly, suggesting that it had an individuality,
      if not a distinction of its own&mdash;that it should no longer be included
      among the vague generalities of rags and bran. Yesterday you began rather
      more boldly. The effects of education upon the development of woman, the
      probability that feeling would survive an intimate acquaintance with Plato
      in the original. Why not take another onward step today? In short, who is
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold laughed&mdash;perhaps uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not without ambition,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that. What form does your ambition take? A colonial judgeship,
      after ten years of idleness at the bar? A success in literature that shall
      compensate you for the favourable criticisms of double that period? The
      ownership of the Derby winner? An American heiress, moving in the best
      society in Monte Carlo? A co-respondency in brackets with a Countess? All
      these are the legitimate aspirations of the modern man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Co-respondency as a career has, no doubt, much to recommend it to some
      tastes,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;It appears to me, however, that it would be easy
      for an indiscreet advocate to over-estimate its practical value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been thinking about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I haven&rsquo;t yet met the countess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, in heaven&rsquo;s name do you hope for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I would say Parliament, if I could be sure that that came within
      the rather narrow restrictions which you assigned to my reply. You said
      &lsquo;in heaven&rsquo;s name.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parliament! Parliament! Great Powers! is it so bad as that with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that it is. I may be able to get over this ambition as I&rsquo;ve
      got over others&mdash;the stroke oar in the Eight, for instance, the soul
      of Sarasate, the heart of Miss Polly Floss of the Music Halls. Up to the
      present, however, I have shown no sign of parting with the surviving
      ambition of many ambitions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that you&rsquo;re a fool,&rdquo; said the man called Edmund. He did not
      speak until the long pause, filled up by the great moan of the Atlantic in
      the distance and the hollow fitful plunge of the waters upon the rocks of
      the Irish shore, had become awkwardly long. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that you&rsquo;re a
      fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good of you, old chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I can&rsquo;t conscientiously say that you&rsquo;re a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again? This is becoming cloying. If I don&rsquo;t mistake, you yourself do a
      little in the line I suggest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would be wisdom&mdash;comparative wisdom&mdash;on my part, might be
      idiotcy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comparative idiotcy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheer idiotcy, on yours. I have several thousands a year, and I can
      almost&mdash;not quite&mdash;but I affirm, almost, afford to talk honestly
      to the Working man. No candidate for Parliament can quite afford to be
      honest to the Working man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Working man returns the compliment, only he works it off on the
      general public,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other man smiled pityingly upon him&mdash;the smile of the professor
      of anatomy upon the student who identifies a thigh bone&mdash;the smile
      which the <i>savant</i> allows himself when brought in contact with a
      discerner of the obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No woman is quite frank in her prayers&mdash;no politician is quite
      honest with the Working man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well. I am prepared to be not quite honest with him too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may believe yourself equal even to that; but it&rsquo;s not so easy as it
      sounds. There is an art in not being quite honest. However, that&rsquo;s a
      detail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I humbly venture so to judge it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The main thing is to get returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The main thing is, as you say, to get the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I should have said the woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman? the money? Ah, that brings us round again in the same circle
      that we traversed yesterday, and the day before. I begin to perceive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hope that you would&mdash;in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if we heard the Banshee after dark,&rdquo; said the Third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are facing things boldly, my dear Harold,&rdquo; said Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of doing anything else?&rdquo; inquired Harold. &ldquo;You know how I
      am situated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is enough. He writes to me that he finds it impossible to continue
      my allowance on its present scale. His expenses are daily increasing, he
      says. I believe him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too many people believe in him,&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;I have never been among
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can easily believe that his expenses are daily increasing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I am easily credulous on that point. Does he go the length of
      assigning any reason for the increase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly preposterous&mdash;he has no notion of the
      responsibilities of fatherhood&mdash;of the propriety of its limitations
      so far as an exchange of confidences is concerned. Why, if it were the
      other way&mdash;if I were to write to tell him that I was in love, I would
      feel a trifle awkward&mdash;I would think it almost indecent to quote
      poetry&mdash;Swinburne&mdash;something about crimson mouths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say; but your father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He writes to tell me that he is in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with some&mdash;well, some woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some woman? I wonder if I know her husband.&rdquo; There was a considerable
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brian pointed a ridiculous, hooked forefinger toward a hollow that from
      beneath resembled a cave, half-way up the precipitous wall of cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where she comes on certain nights of the year. She stands at the
      entrance to that cave, and cries for her lover as she cried that night
      when she came only to find his dead body,&rdquo; said Brian, neutralizing the
      suggested tragedy in his narrative by keeping exhibited that comical crook
      in his index finger. &ldquo;Ay, your honours, it&rsquo;s a quare story of pity.&rdquo; Both
      his auditors looked first at his face, then at the crook in his finger,
      and laughed. They declined to believe in the pity of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is preposterous,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;He writes to me that he never quite
      knew before what it was to love. He knows it now, he says, and as it&rsquo;s
      more expensive than he ever imagined it could be, he&rsquo;s reluctantly
      compelled to cut down my allowance. Then it is that he begins to talk of
      the crimson mouth&mdash;I fancy it&rsquo;s followed by something about the
      passion of the fervid South&mdash;so like my father, but like no other man
      in the world. He adds that perhaps one day I may also know &lsquo;what&rsquo;tis to
      love.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present, however, he insists on your looking at that form of happiness
      through another man&rsquo;s eyes? Your father loves, and you are to learn&mdash;approximately&mdash;what
      it costs, and pay the expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the situation of the present hour. What am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry Helen Craven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s brutally frank, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, you&rsquo;re not a working man with a vote. I can afford to be frank
      with you. Of course, that question which you have asked me is the one that
      was on your mind two days ago, when you began to talk about what you
      called &lsquo;woman in the abstract.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say it was. We have had two stories from Brian in the meantime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Harold, your case is far from being unique. Some of its elements
      may present new features, but, taken as a whole, it is commonplace. You
      have ambition, but you have also a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far I am in line with the commonplace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot hope to realize your aims without money, and the only way by
      which a man can acquire a large amount of money suddenly, is by a deal on
      the Stock Exchange or at Monte Carlo, or by matrimony. The last is the
      safest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about that. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know what&rsquo;s in your mind. I&rsquo;ve read the scene between Captain
      Absolute and his father in &lsquo;The Rivals&rsquo;&mdash;I read countless fictions up
      to the point where the writers artlessly introduce the same scene, then I
      throw away the books. With the examples we have all had of the success of
      the <i>mariage de convenance</i> and of the failure of the <i>mariage
      d&rsquo;amour</i> it is absurd to find fault with the Johnsonian dictum about
      marriages made by the Lord Chancellor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;Only I don&rsquo;t quite see why, if Dr. Johnson
      didn&rsquo;t believe that marriages were made in heaven, there was any necessity
      for him to run off to the other extreme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He merely said, I fancy, that a marriage arranged by the Lord Chancellor
      was as likely to turn out happily as one that was&mdash;well, made in
      heaven, if you insist on the phrase. Heaven, as a match-maker, has much to
      learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; said Harold, with an affectation of cynicism that
      amused his friend and puzzled Brian, who had ears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to sacrifice
      one ambition in order to secure the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in love just now&mdash;so
      much is certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could be more certain,&rdquo; acquiesced Harold, with a laugh. &ldquo;And now
      I suppose it is equally certain that I never shall be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort. That cynicism which delights to suggest that
      marriage is fatal to love, is as false as it is pointless. Let any man
      keep his eyes open and he will see that marriage is the surest guarantee
      that exists of the permanence of love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as an I O U is a guarantee&mdash;it&rsquo;s a legal form. The money can be
      legally demanded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a trifle obscure in your parallel,&rdquo; remarked Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely suggested that the marriage ceremony is an I O U for the debt
      which is love. Oh, this sort of beating about a question and making it the
      subject of phrases can lead nowhere. Never mind. I believe that, on the
      whole, the grain of advice which I have acquired out of your bushel of
      talk, is good, and is destined to bear good fruit. I&rsquo;ll have my career in
      the world, that my father may learn &lsquo;what&rsquo;tis to love.&rsquo; My mind is made
      up. Come, Brian, to the shore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till I tell your honour the story of the lovely young Princess
      Fither,&rdquo; said the boatman, assuming a sentimental expression that was
      extremely comical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brian, Prince of Storytellers, let it be brief,&rdquo; said Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to his honour I&rsquo;m telling this story, not to your honour, Mr.
      Airey,&rdquo; said Brian. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a way of wrinkling up your eyes, I notice,
      when you speak that word &lsquo;love,&rsquo; and if you don&rsquo;t put your tongue in your
      cheek when anyone else comes across that word accidental-like, you put
      your tongue in your cheek when you&rsquo;re alone, and when you think over what
      has been said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re a student of men as well as an observer of nature, O Prince,&rdquo;
       laughed Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve only eyes and ears,&rdquo; said Brian, in a deprecating tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a certain skill in narrative,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;What about the beauteous
      Princess Fither? What dynasty did she belong to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She belonged to Cashelderg,&rdquo; replied Brian. &ldquo;A few stones of the ruin may
      still be seen, if you&rsquo;ve any imagination, on the brink of the cliff that&rsquo;s
      called Carrigorm&mdash;you can just perceive its shape above the cove
      where his lordship&rsquo;s boathouse is built.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I see the cliff&mdash;just where a castle might at one time have
      been built. And that&rsquo;s the dynasty that she belonged to?&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same, sir. And on our side you may still see&mdash;always supposing
      that you have the imagination&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, nothing imaginary can be seen without the aid of the
      imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may see the ruins of what might have been Cashel-na-Mara, where the
      Macnamara held his court&mdash;Mac na Mara means Son of the Waves, you
      must know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of notoriety,&rdquo; said Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Macnamaras and the Casheldergs were the deadliest of enemies, and
      hardly a day passed for years&mdash;maybe centuries&mdash;without some one
      of the clan getting the better of the other. Maybe that was how the
      surplus population was kept down in these parts. Anyhow there was no talk,
      so far as I&rsquo;ve heard, of congested districts in them days. Well, sir, it
      so happened that the Prince of the Macnamaras was a fine, handsome, and
      brave young fellow, and the Princess Fither of Cashelderg was the most
      beautiful of Irish women, and that&rsquo;s saying a good deal. As luck would
      have it, the young people came together. Her boat was lost in a fog one
      night and drifting upon the sharp rocks beyond the headland. The cries of
      the poor girl were heard on both sides of the Lough&mdash;the blessed
      Lough where we&rsquo;re now floating&mdash;but no one was brave enough to put
      out to the rescue of the Princess&mdash;no one, did I say? Who is it that
      makes a quick leap off the cliffs into the rolling waters beneath? He
      fights his way, strong swimmer that he is! through the surge, and, unseen
      by any eye by reason of the fog, he reaches the Princess&rsquo;s boat. Her cries
      cease. And a keen arises along the cliffs of Carrigorm, for her friends
      think that she has been swallowed up in the cruel waves. The keen goes on,
      but it&rsquo;s sudden changed into a shout of joy; for a noble young figure
      appears as if by magic on the cliff head, and places the precious burden
      of her lovely daughter in the arms of her weeping mother, and then
      vanishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so the feud was healed, and if they didn&rsquo;t live happy, we may,&rdquo; said
      Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all you know about the spirit of an ancient Irish family quarrel,&rdquo;
       said Brian pityingly. &ldquo;No, sir. The brave deed of the young Prince only
      made the quarrel the bitterer. But the young people had fallen in love
      with each other, and they met in secret in that cave that you see there
      just above us&mdash;the Banshee&rsquo;s Cave, it&rsquo;s called to this day. The
      lovely Princess put off in her boat night after night, and climbed the
      cliff face&mdash;there was no path in them days&mdash;to where her lover
      was waiting for her in the cave. But at last some wretch unworthy of the
      name of a man got to learn the secret and told it to the Princess&rsquo;s
      father. With half-a-dozen of the clan he lay in wait for the young Prince
      in the cave, and they stabbed him in twelve places with their daggers. And
      even while they were doing the murder, the song of the Princess was heard,
      telling her lover that she was coming. She climbed the face of the cliff
      and with a laugh ran into the trysting-place. She stumbled over the body
      of her lover. Her father stole out of the darkness of the cave and grasped
      her by the wrist. Then there rang out over the waters the cry, which still
      sounds on some nights from a cave&mdash;the cry of the girl when she
      learned the truth&mdash;the cry of the girl as, with a superhuman effort,
      she released herself from her father&rsquo;s iron grasp, and sprang from the
      head of the cliff you see there above, into the depths of the waters where
      we&rsquo;re now floating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause before Edmund remarked, &ldquo;Your story of the
      Montague-Macnamaras and the Capulet-Casheldergs is a sad one, Brian. And
      you have heard the cry of the young Princess with your own ears, I dare
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I have, your honour. And it&rsquo;s the story of the young Princess Fither
      and her lover that I tell to gentlemen that put their tongues in their
      cheeks when they&rsquo;re alone, and thinking of the way the less knowing ones
      talk of love and the heart of a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both Edmund and Harold began to think that perhaps the Irish boatman was a
      shrewder and a more careful listener than they had given him.

      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;ON FABLES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">V</span>ERY amusing indeed
      was Edmund&rsquo;s parody of the boatman&rsquo;s wildly-romantic story. The travesty
      was composed for the benefit of Miss Craven, and the time of its
      communication was between the courses of the very excellent dinner which
      Lord Innisfail had provided for his numerous guests at his picturesque
      Castle overlooking Lough Suangorm&mdash;that magnificent fjord on the West
      Coast of Ireland. Lord Innisfail was a true Irishman. When he was away
      from Ireland he was ever longing to be back in it, and when he was in
      Ireland he was ever trying to get away from it. The result of his
      patriotism was a residence of a month in Connaught in the autumn, and the
      rest of the year in Connaught Square or Monte Carlo. He was accustomed to
      declare&mdash;in England&mdash;that Ireland and the Irish were
      magnificent. If this was his conviction, his self-abnegation, displayed by
      carefully avoiding both, except during a month every year, was all the
      greater.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet no one ever gave him credit for possessing the virtue of
      self-abnegation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He declared&mdash;in England&mdash;that the Irish race was the finest on
      the face of the earth, and he invariably filled his Castle with
      Englishmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was idolized by his Irish tenantry, and they occasionally left a few
      birds for his guests to shoot on his moors during the latter days of
      August.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Innisfail was a man of about fifty years of age. His wife was forty
      and looked twenty-five: their daughter was eighteen and looked
      twenty-four.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund Airey, who was trying to amuse Miss Craven by burlesquing the
      romance of the Princess Fither, was the representative in Parlament of an
      English constituency. His father had been in business&mdash;some people
      said on the Stock Exchange, which would be just the opposite. He had,
      however, died leaving his son a considerable fortune extremely well
      invested&mdash;a fact which tended strongly against the Stock Exchange
      theory. His son showed no desire to go on the turf or to live within reach
      to the European gaming-table. If there was any truth in the Stock Exchange
      theory, this fact tended to weaken the doctrine of heredity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never blustered on the subject of his independence of thought or
      action. He had attached himself unobtrusively to the Government party on
      entering Parlament, and he had never occasioned the Whips a moment&rsquo;s
      anxiety during the three years that had elapsed since the date of his
      return. He was always found in the Government Lobby in a division, and he
      was thus regarded by the Ministers as an extremely conscientious man. This
      is only another way of saying that he was regarded by the Opposition as an
      extremely unscrupulous man.
    </p>
    <p>
      His speeches were brief, but each of them contained a phrase which told
      against the Opposition. He was wise enough to refrain from introducing
      into any speech so doubtful an auxiliary as argument, in his attempts to
      convince the Opposition that they were in the wrong. He had the good sense
      to perceive early in his career that argument goes for nothing in the
      House of Commons, but that trusted Governments have been turned out of
      office by a phrase. This power of perception induced him to cultivate the
      art of phrase-making. His dexterity in this direction had now and again
      made the Opposition feel uncomfortable; and as making the Opposition feel
      uncomfortable embodies the whole science of successful party-government in
      England, it was generally assumed that, if the Opposition could only be
      kept out of power after the General Election, Edmund Airey would be
      rewarded by an Under-Secretaryship.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a year or two under forty, tall, slender, and so
      distinguished-looking that some people&mdash;they were not his friends&mdash;were
      accustomed to say that it was impossible that he could ever attain to
      political distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He assured Miss Craven that, sitting in the stern sheets of the boat, idly
      rocking on the smooth swell that rolled through the Lough from the
      Atlantic, was by far the most profitable way of spending two hours of the
      afternoon. Miss Craven doubted if this was a fact. &ldquo;Where did the profit
      come in except to the boatman?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Airey, who knew that Miss Craven was anxious to know if Harold had
      been of the profitable boating-party, had no idea of allowing his powers
      of travesty to be concealed by the account, for which the young woman was
      longing, of Harold and the topics upon which he had conversed. He assured
      her that it was eminently profitable for anyone interested in comparative
      mythology, to be made acquainted with the Irish equivalent to the Mantuan
      fable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fable!&rdquo; almost shrieked Miss Craven. &ldquo;Mantuan fable! Do you mean to
      suggest that there never was a Romeo and Juliet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I mean to say that there have been several,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Airey. &ldquo;They exist in all languages. I have come unexpectedly upon them in
      India, then in Japan, afterwards they turned up, with some delicate Maori
      variations, in New Zealand when I was there. I might have been prepared
      for them at such a place as this You know how the modern melodramas are
      made, Miss Craven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read somewhere, but I forget. And you sat alone in the boat
      smoking, while the boatman droned out his stories?&rdquo; remarked the young
      woman, refusing a cold <i>entrée</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you how the melodramas are made,&rdquo; said Mr. Airey, refusing to
      be led up to Harold as a topic. &ldquo;The artist paints several effective
      pictures of scenery and then one of the collaborateurs&mdash;the man who
      can&rsquo;t write, for want of the grammar, but who knows how far to go with the
      public&mdash;invents the situation to work in with the scenery. Last of
      all, the man who has grammar&mdash;some grammar&mdash;fills in the details
      of the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really! How interesting! And that&rsquo;s how Shakespeare wrote &lsquo;Romeo and
      Juliet&rsquo;? What a fund of knowledge you have, Mr. Airey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Airey, by the method of his disclaimer, laid claim to a much larger
      fund than any that Miss Craven had attributed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only meant to suggest that traditional romance is evolved on the same
      lines,&rdquo; said he, when his deprecatory head-shakes had ceased. &ldquo;Given the
      scenic effects of &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rsquo; the romance on the lines of &lsquo;Romeo
      and Juliet&rsquo; will be forthcoming, if you only wait long enough. When you
      pay a visit to any romantic glen with a torrent&mdash;an amateurish copy
      of an unknown Salvator Rosa&mdash;ask for the &lsquo;Lover&rsquo;s Leap&rsquo; and it will
      be shown to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Given, as scenic details, the ruin of a Castle on one side of the Lough,
      the ruin of a Castle on the other, and the names of the hereditary
      enemies, the story comes naturally&mdash;quite as naturally&mdash;not to
      say overmuch about it&mdash;as the story of the melodrama follows the
      sketch of the scenic effects in the theatre. The transition from Montague
      to Macnamara&mdash;from Capulet to Cashelderg is easy, and there you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here we are,&rdquo; laughed Miss Craven. &ldquo;How delightful it is to be able
      to work out a legend in that way, is it not, Mr. Durdan?&rdquo; and she turned
      to a man sitting at her left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite delightful, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Durdan. &ldquo;But Airey is only
      adapting the creed of his party to matters of everyday life. What people
      say about his party is that they make a phrase first and then look out for
      a policy to hang upon it. Government by phrase is what the country is
      compelled to submit to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Durdan was a prominent member of the Opposition.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;ON A PERILOUS CAUSEWAY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ISS CRAVEN laughed
      and watched Mr. Airey searching for a reply beneath the frill of a
      Neapolitan ice. She did not mean that he should find one. Her aim was that
      he should talk about Harold Wynne. The dinner had reached its pianissimo
      passages, so to speak. It was dwindling away into the <i>marrons glacés</i>
      and <i>fondants</i> stage, so she had not much time left to her to find
      out if it was indeed with his friend Edmund Airey that Harold had
      disappeared every afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund Airey knew what her aim was. He was a clever man, and he
      endeavoured to frustrate it. Ten minutes afterwards he was amazed to find
      that he had told her all that she wanted to know, and something over, for
      he had told her that Harold was at present greatly interested in the
      question of the advisability of a man&rsquo;s entering public life by the
      perilous causeway&mdash;the phrase was Edmund Airey&rsquo;s&mdash;of matrimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he chose a cigar for himself&mdash;for there was a choice even among
      Lord Innisfail&rsquo;s cigars&mdash;he was actually amazed to find that the
      girl&rsquo;s purpose had been too strong for his resolution. He actually felt as
      if he had betrayed his friend to the enemy&mdash;he actually put the
      matter in this way in his moment of self-reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before his cigar was well alight, however, he had become more reasonable
      in his censorship of his own weakness. An enemy? Why, the young woman was
      the best friend that Harold Wynne could possibly have. She was young&mdash;that
      is, young enough&mdash;she was clever&mdash;had she not got the better of
      Edmund Airey?&mdash;and, best of all, she was an heiress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The perilous causeway of matrimony&rdquo;&mdash;that was the phrase which had
      come suddenly into his mind, and, in order to introduce it, he had sent
      the girl away feeling that she was cleverer than he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The perilous causeway of matrimony,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;With a handrail of ten
      thousand a year&mdash;there is safety in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down the long dining-hall, glistening with silver, to where
      Harold stood facing the great window, the square of which framed a dim
      picture of a mountain slope, purple with heather, that had snared the last
      light of the sunken sun. The sea horizon cut upon the slope not far from
      its summit, and in that infinity of Western distance there was a dash of
      drifting crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold Wynne stood watching that picture of the mountain with the Atlantic
      beyond, and Edmund watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal of conversation flying about the room. The smokers
      of cigarettes talked on a topic which they would probably have called Art.
      The smokers of pipes explained in a circumstantial way, that carried
      suspicion with it to the ears of all listeners, their splendid failures to
      secure certain big fish during the day. The smokers of cigars talked of
      the Horse and the House&mdash;mostly of the Horse. There was a rather
      florid judge present&mdash;he had talked himself crimson to the
      appreciative woman who had sat beside him at dinner, on the subject of the
      previous racing-season, and now he was talking himself purple on the
      subject of the future season. He had been at Castle Innisfail for three
      days, and he had steadily refused to entertain the idea of talking on any
      other subject than the Horse from the standpoint of a possible backer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the judge, who, during the hearing of a celebrated case a few
      months before&mdash;a case that had involved a reference to an event known
      as the City and Suburban, inquired if that was the name of a Railway
      Company. Hearing that it was a race, he asked if it was a horse race or a
      dog race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold remained on his feet in front of the window, and Edmund remained
      watching him until the streak of crimson had dwindled to a flaming Rahab
      thread. The servants entered the room with coffee, and brought out many
      subtle gleams from the old oak by lighting the candles in the silver
      sconces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time that the door was opened, the sound of a human voice (female)
      trying, but with indifferent success, to scale the heights of a song that
      had been saleable by reason of its suggestions of passion&mdash;drawing-room
      passion&mdash;saleable passion&mdash;fought its way through the tobacco
      smoke of the dining-hall. Hearing it fitfully, such men as might have felt
      inclined to leave half-smoked cigars for the sake of the purer atmosphere
      of the drawingroom, became resigned to their immediate surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whisper had gone round the table while dinner was in progress, that Miss
      Stafford had promised&mdash;some people said threatened&mdash;to recite
      something in the course of the evening. Miss Stafford was a
      highly-educated young woman. She spoke French, German, Italian and
      Spanish. This is only another way of saying that she could be
      uninteresting in four languages. In addition to the ordinary
      disqualifications of such young women, she recited a little&mdash;mostly
      poems about early childhood, involving a lisp and a pinafore. She wished
      to do duty as an object lesson of the possibility of combining with an
      exhaustive knowledge of mathematical formulæ, the strongest instincts of
      femininity. Mathematics and motherhood were not necessarily opposed to one
      another, her teachers had assured the world, through the medium of
      magazine articles. Formulæ and femininity went hand in hand, they
      endeavoured to prove, through the medium of Miss Stafford&rsquo;s recitations;
      so she acquired the imaginary lisp of early childhood, and tore a pinafore
      to shreds in the course of fifteen stanzas.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was generally understood among men that one of these recitations amply
      repaid a listener for a careful avoidance of the apartment where it took
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The threat that had been whispered round the dinner-table formed an excuse
      for long tarrying in front of the coffee cups and Bénédictine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; at length said Lord Innisfail, endeavouring to put on an effective
      Irish brogue&mdash;he thought it was only due to Ireland to put on a
      month&rsquo;s brogue. &ldquo;Boys, we&rsquo;ll face it like men. Shall it be said in the
      days to come that we ran away from a lisp and a pinafore?&rdquo; Then suddenly
      remembering that Miss Stafford was his guest, he became grave. &ldquo;Her father
      was my friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He rode straight. What&rsquo;s the matter with the
      girl? If she does know all about the binomial-theorem and German
      philosophy, has she not some redeeming qualities? You needn&rsquo;t tell me that
      there&rsquo;s not some good in a young woman who commits to memory such stuff as
      that&mdash;that what&rsquo;s its name&mdash;the little boy that&rsquo;s run over by a
      &lsquo;bus or something or other and that lisps in consequence about his pap-pa.
      No, you needn&rsquo;t argue with me. It&rsquo;s extremely kind of her to offer to
      recite, and I will stand up for her, confound her! And if anyone wants to
      come round with the Judge and me to the stables while she&rsquo;s reciting,
      now&rsquo;s the time. Will you take another glass of claret, Wynne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to the drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed the men who were straggling into the great square hall where a
      billiard table occupied an insignificant space. The skeleton of an ancient
      Irish elk formed a rather more conspicuous object in the hall, and was
      occasionally found handy for the disposal of hats, rugs, and overcoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is greatly interested in the Romeo and Juliet story,&rdquo; remarked
      Edmund, strolling up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;who?&rdquo; asked Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl&mdash;the necessary girl. The&mdash;let us say, alternative. The&mdash;the
      handrail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The handrail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Oh, I forgot: you were not within hearing. There was something said
      about the perilous causeway of matrimony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that suggested the handrail idea to you? No better idea ever occurred
      even to you, O man of many ideas, and of still more numerous phrases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is responsive&mdash;she is also clever&mdash;she is uncommonly clever&mdash;she
      got the better of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more about her cleverness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say no more about it. A man cannot go a better way about checking
      an incipient passion for a young woman than by insisting on her
      cleverness. We do not take to the clever ones. Our ideal does not include
      a power of repartee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incipient passion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a suspicion of bitterness in Harold&rsquo;s voice, as he repeated the
      words of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incipient passion! I think we had better go into the drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went into the drawing-room.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ISS CRAVEN was
      sitting on a distant sofa listening, or pretending to listen, which is
      precisely the same thing, with great earnestness to the discourse of Mr.
      Durdan, who, besides being an active politician, had a theory upon the
      question of what Ibsen meant by his &ldquo;Master Builder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold said a few words to Miss Innisfail, who was trying to damp her
      mother&rsquo;s hope of getting up a dance in the hall, but Lady Innisfail
      declined to be suppressed even by her daughter, and had received promises
      of support for her enterprise in influential quarters. Finding that her
      mother was likely to succeed, the girl hastened away to entreat one of her
      friends to play a &ldquo;piece&rdquo; on the pianoforte.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that she might safely depend upon the person to whom she applied
      for this favour, to put a stop to her mother&rsquo;s negotiations. The lady
      performed in the old style. Under her hands the one instrument discharged
      the office of several. The volume of sound suggested that produced by the
      steam orchestra of a switchback railway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold glanced across the room and perceived that, while the performer was
      tearing notes by the handful and flinging them about the place&mdash;up in
      the air, against the walls&mdash;while her hands were worrying the bass
      notes one moment like rival terrier puppies over a bone, and at other
      times tickling the treble rather too roughly to be good fun&mdash;Miss
      Craven&rsquo;s companion had not abandoned the hope of making himself audible if
      not intelligible. He had clearly accepted the challenge thrown down by the
      performer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold perceived that a man behind him had furtively unlatched one of the
      windows leading to the terrace, and was escaping by that means, and not
      alone. From outside came the hearty laughter of the judge telling an
      open-air story to his host. People looked anxiously toward the window.
      Harold shook his head as though suggesting that that sort of interruption
      must be put a stop to at once, and that he was the man to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went resolutely out through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
      Edmund, in the ear of Lady Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke too soon. The judge&rsquo;s laugh rolled along like the breaking of a
      tidal wave. It was plain that Harold had not gone to remonstrate with the
      judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not. He had merely strolled round the terrace to the entrance hall.
      Here he picked up one of the many caps which were hanging there, and
      putting it on his head, walked idly away from the castle, hearing only the
      floating eulogy uttered by the judge of a certain well-known jockey who
      was, he said, the kindliest and most honourable soul that had ever pulled
      the favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      A longing had come to him to hurry as far as he could from the Castle and
      its company&mdash;they were hateful to him just at that instant. The
      shocking performance of the woman at the pianoforte, the chatter of his
      fellow-guests, the delicate way in which his friend Edmund Airey made the
      most indelicate allusions, the <i>nisi prius</i> jocularity of the judge&mdash;he
      turned away from all with a feeling of repulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet Lord Innisfail&rsquo;s cook was beyond reproach as an artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold Wynne had accepted the invitation of Lady Innisfail in cold blood.
      She had asked him to go to Castle Innisfail for a few weeks in August,
      adding, &ldquo;Helen Craven has promised to be among our party. You like her,
      don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immensely,&rdquo; he had replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; she had cried, with an enthusiasm that would have shocked her
      daughter. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a discordant note at our gathering. If you look
      coldly on Helen Craven I shall wish that I hadn&rsquo;t asked you; but if you
      look on her in&mdash;well, in the other way, we shall all be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew exactly what Lady Innisfail meant to convey. It had been hinted to
      him before that, as he was presumably desirous of marrying a girl with a
      considerable amount of money, he could not do better than ask Miss Craven
      to be his wife. He had then laughed and assured Lady Innisfail that if
      their happiness depended upon the way he looked upon Miss Craven, it would
      be his aim to look upon her in any way that Lady Innisfail might suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he had come to Castle Innisfail, and for a week he had given himself
      up to the vastness of the Western Cliffs&mdash;of the Atlantic waves&mdash;of
      the billowy mountains&mdash;of the mysterious sunsets. It was impossible
      to escape from the overwhelming influence of the Atlantic in the region of
      Castle Innisfail. Its sound seemed to go out to all the ends of the earth.
      At the Castle there was no speech or language where its voice was not
      heard. It was a sort of background of sound that had to be arranged for by
      anyone desirous of expressing any thought or emotion in that region. Even
      the judge had to take it into consideration upon occasions. He never took
      into consideration anything less important than an ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week the influence of the Atlantic had overwhelmed Harold. He had
      given himself up to it. He had looked at Miss Craven neither coldly nor in
      the other way&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;to which Lady Innisfail had
      referred as desirable to be adopted by him. Miss Craven had simply not
      been in his thoughts. Face to face with the Infinite one hesitates to give
      up one&rsquo;s attention to a question of an income that may be indicated by
      five figures only.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the end of a week, he received a letter from his father, who was
      Lord Fotheringay, and this letter rang many changes upon the
      five-figure-income question. The question was more than all the Infinities
      to Lord Fotheringay, and he suggested as much in writing to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Craven is all that is desirable,&rdquo; the letter had said. &ldquo;Of course
      she is not an American; but one cannot expect everything in this imperfect
      world. Her money is, I understand, well invested&mdash;not in land, thank
      heaven! She is, in fact, a CERTAINTY, and certainties are becoming rarer
      every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the letter went on to refer to some abstract questions of the opera
      in Italy&mdash;it was to the opera in Italy that Lord Fotheringay w as,
      for the time being, attached. The progress made by one of its ornaments&mdash;gifted
      with a singularly flexible soprano&mdash;interested him greatly, and
      Harold had invariably found that in proportion to the interest taken by
      his father in the exponents of certain arts&mdash;singing, dancing, and
      the drama&mdash;his own allowance was reduced. He knew that his father was
      not a rich man, for a peer. His income was only a trifle over twelve
      thousand a year; but he also knew that only for his father&rsquo;s weaknesses,
      this sum should be sufficient for him to live on with some degree of
      comfort. The weaknesses, however, were there, and they had to be
      calculated on. Harold calculated on them; and after doing the sum in
      simple subtraction with the sound of the infinite ocean around him, he had
      asked his friend Edmund Airey to pass a few hours in the boat with him.
      Edmund had complied for three consecutive afternoons, with the result
      that, with three ridiculous stories from the Irish boatman, Harold had
      acquired a certain amount of sound advice from the friend who was in his
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made up his mind that, if Miss Craven would marry him, he would
      endeavour to make her the wife of a distinguished man.
    </p>
    <p>
      That included everything, did it not?
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he might realize the brilliant future predicted for him by
      his friends when he was the leader of the party of the hour at Oxford. The
      theory of the party was&mdash;like everything that comes from Oxford&mdash;eminently
      practical. The Regeneration of Humanity by means of Natural Scenery was
      its foundation. Its advocates proved to their own satisfaction that, in
      every question of morality and the still more important question of
      artistic feeling, heredity was not the dominant influence, but natural
      scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the party Harold was regarded as the long-looked-for Man&mdash;what the
      world wanted was a Man, they declared, and he was destined to be the Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had travelled a good deal on leaving the University, and in a year he
      had forgotten that he had ever pretended that he held any theory. A theory
      he had come to believe to be the paper fortress of the Immature. But the
      Man&mdash;that was a different thing. He hoped that he might yet prove
      himself to be a man, so that, after all, his friends&mdash;they had also
      ceased to theorize&mdash;might not have predicted in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many young men without experience, he believed that Parliament was a
      great power. If anyone had told him that the art of gerrymandering is
      greater than the art of governing, he would not have known what his
      informant meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      His aspirations took the direction of a seat in the House of Commons. In
      spite of the fact of his being the son of Lord Fotheringay, he believed
      that he might make his mark in that Assembly. The well-known love of the
      Voter for social purity&mdash;not necessarily in Beer&mdash;and his
      intolerance of idleness&mdash;excepting, of course, when it is paid for by
      an employer&mdash;had, he knew, to be counted on. Lord Fotheringay was
      not, he felt, the ideal of the Working man, but he hoped he might be able
      to convince the Working man&mdash;the Voter&mdash;that Lord Fotheringay&rsquo;s
      most noted characteristics had not descended to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his concern on this point it will be readily understood how striking
      a figure was the Voter, in his estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not so easy to understand how, with that ideal Voter&mdash;that
      stern unbending moralist&mdash;before his eyes, he should feel that there
      was a great need for him to be possessed of money before offering himself
      to any constituency. The fact remained, however, that everyone to whom he
      had confided his Parliamentary aspirations, had assured him at the outset
      that money had to be secured before a constituency could be reckoned on.
      His friend Edmund Airey had still further impressed upon him this fact;
      and now he had made up his mind that his aspirations should not be
      discouraged through the lack of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would ask Helen Craven that very night if she would have the goodness
      to marry him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;ON THE ADVANTAGES OF A FULL MOON.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HY the fact of his
      having made up his mind to ask Miss Craven who, without being an American,
      still possessed many qualities which are generally accepted as tending to
      married happiness, should cause him to feel a great longing to leave
      Castle Innisfail, its occupants, and its occupations behind him for
      evermore, it is difficult to explain on any rational grounds. That feeling
      was, however, upon him, and he strode away across the billowy moorland in
      the direction of the cliffs of the fjord known as Lough Suangorm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was at its full. It had arisen some little way up the sky and was
      showering its red gold down the slopes of the two cone-shaped mountains
      that guard the pass of Lamdhu; the deep glen was flooded with moonlight&mdash;Harold
      could perceive in its hollows such objects as were scarcely visible on the
      ordinary gray days of the West of Ireland. Then he walked until he was on
      the brink of the great cliffs overhanging the lough. From the high point
      on which he stood he could follow all the curves of the lough out to the
      headlands at its entrance seven miles away. Beyond those headlands the
      great expanse of sea was glittering splendidly in the moonlight, though
      the moon had not risen high enough to touch the restless waters at the
      base of the cl iffs on which he stood. The waters were black as they
      struggled within their narrow limits and were strangled in the channel.
      Only a white thread of surf marked the breaking place of the waves upon
      the cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down the little track, made among the rocks of the steep slope,
      until he reached the natural cavern that bore the name of the Banshee&rsquo;s
      Cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was scarcely half-way up the face of the cliff. From that hollow in the
      rocks the descent to the waters of the lough was sheer; but the cave was
      easily accessible by a zig-zag path leading up from a small ledge of rocks
      which, being protected by a reef that started up abruptly half a dozen
      yards out in the narrow channel, served as a landing place for the fishing
      boats, of which there were several owned in the tiny village of Carrigorm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood at the entrance to the cavern, thinking, not upon the scene
      which, according to the boatman&rsquo;s story, had been enacted at the place
      several hundreds&mdash;perhaps thousands (the chronology of Irish legends
      is vague)&mdash;of years before, but upon his own prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is done,&rdquo; he said, looking the opposite cliffs straight in the face,
      as though they were Voters&mdash;(candidates usually look at the Voters
      straight in the face the first time they address them). &ldquo;It is done; I
      cast it to the winds&mdash;to the seas, that are as indifferent to man&rsquo;s
      affairs as the winds. I must be content to live without it. The career&mdash;that
      is enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What it was that he meant to cast to the indifference of the seas and the
      winds was nothing more than a sentiment&mdash;a vague feeling that he
      could not previously get rid of&mdash;a feeling that man&rsquo;s life without
      woman&rsquo;s love was something incomplete and unsatisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had his theory on this subject as well as on others long ago&mdash;he
      had gone the length of embodying it in sonnets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it now to go the way of the other impracticable theories?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had cherished it for long. If it had not been dear to him he would not
      have subjected himself to the restriction of the sonnet in writing about
      it. He would have adopted the commonplace and facile stanza. But a sonnet
      is a shrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had felt that whatever might happen to him, however disappointed he
      might become with the world and the things of the world, that great and
      splendid love was before him, and he felt that to realize it would be to
      forget all disappointments&mdash;to forget all the pangs which the heart
      of man knows when its hour of disillusion comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love was the reward of the struggle&mdash;the deep, sweet draught that
      refreshes the heart of the toiler, he felt. In whatever direction illusion
      may lie, love was not in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      That had been his firm belief all his life, and now he was standing at the
      entrance to the cavern&mdash;the cavern that was associated with a story
      of love stronger than death&mdash;and he had just assured himself that he
      had flung to the seas and the winds all his hopes of that love which had
      been in his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is gone&mdash;it is gone!&rdquo; he cried, looking down at that narrow part
      of the lough where the boat had been tumbling during the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had that adviser of his said? He remembered something of his words&mdash;something
      about marriage being a guarantee of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold laughed grimly as he recalled the words. He knew better. The love
      that he had looked for was not such as was referred to by his friend Mr.
      Airey. It was&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But what on earth was the good of trying to recall what it was? The
      diamonds that Queen Guinevere flung into the river, made just the same
      splash as common stones would have done under the same circumstances: and
      the love which he had cherished was, when cast to the winds, no more
      worthy of being thought precious than the many other ideas which he had
      happily rid himself of in the course of his walk through the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was how he repressed the thought of his conversation with his friend;
      and after a while the recollections that he wished to suppress yielded to
      his methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the influences of the place&mdash;the spectacle of the infinite
      mountains, the voice of the infinite sea&mdash;asserted themselves as they
      had done during the first week of his arrival at the Castle. The story of
      the legendary Prince and Princess came back to him as though it were the
      embodiment of the influences of the region of romance in the midst of
      which he was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had Brian the boatman said? The beautiful girl had crossed the narrow
      channel of the lough night after night and had climbed the face of the
      cliffs to her lover at their dizzy trysting-place&mdash;the place where he
      was now standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even while he thought upon the details, as carefully narrated by the
      boatman, the moon rose high enough to send her rays sweeping over the full
      length of the lough. For a quarter of an hour a single thin crag of the
      Slieve Gorm mountains had stood between the moon and the narrowing of the
      lough. The orb rose over the last thin peak of the crag. The lough through
      all its sinuous length flashed beneath his eyes like a Malayan crease, and
      in the waters just below the cliffs which a moment before had been black,
      he saw a small boat being rowed by a white figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the lovely Princess of the story,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;She is in white&mdash;of
      course they are all in white, these princesses. It&rsquo;s marvellous what a
      glint of moonlight can do. It throws a glamour over the essentially
      commonplace, the same way that&mdash;well, that that fancy known as love
      does upon occasions, otherwise the plain features of a woman would perish
      from the earth and not be perpetuated. The lumpy daughter of the village
      who exists simply to show what an artist was Jean François Millet, appears
      down there to float through the moonlight like the restless spirit of a
      princess. Is she coming to meet the spirit of her lover at their old
      trysting-place? Ah, no, she is probably about to convey a pannikin of
      worms for bait to one of the fishing boats.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;ON THE ZIG-ZAG TRACK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>AROLD WYNNE was in
      one of those moods which struggle for expression through the medium of
      bitter phrases. He felt that he did well to be cynical. Had he not
      outlived his belief in love as a necessity of life?
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched with some degree of interest the progress of the tiny boat
      rowed by the white figure. He had tried to bring himself to believe that
      the figure was that of a rough fisher-girl&mdash;the fisher-girls are not
      rough, however, on that part of the coast, and he knew it, only his mood
      tended to roughness. He tried to make himself believe that a coarse jest
      shrieked through the moonlight to reach the ears of an appreciatively
      coarse fisherman, would not be inconsistent with the appearance of that
      white figure. He felt quite equal to the act of looking beneath the glory
      and the glamour of the moonlight and of seeing there only the commonplace.
      He was, he believed, in a mood to revel in the disillusion of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet he watched the progress of the boat through the glittering waters,
      without removing his eyes from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white figure in the boat was so white as to seem the centre of the
      light that flashed along the ripples and silvered the faces of the cliffs&mdash;so
      much was apparent to him in spite of his mood. As the boat approached the
      landing-place at the ledge of rock a hundred feet below him, he also
      perceived that the rower handled her oars in a scientific way unknown to
      the fisher-girls; and the next thing that he noticed was that she wore a
      straw hat and a blouse of a pattern that the fisher-girls were powerless
      to imitate, though the skill was easily available to the Mary Anns and the
      Matilda Janes who steer (indifferently) perambulators through the London
      parks. He was so interested in what he saw, that he had not sufficient
      presence of mind to resume his cynical mutterings, or to inquire if it was
      possible that the fashion of the year as regards sailor hats and blouses,
      was a repetition of that of the period of the Princess Fither.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was more than interested&mdash;he was puzzled&mdash;as the boat was
      skilfully run alongside the narrow landing ledge at the foot of the
      cliffs, and when the girl&mdash;the figure was clearly that of a girl&mdash;landed&mdash;-she
      wore yachting shoes&mdash;carrying with her the boat&rsquo;s painter, which she
      made fast in a business-like way to one of the iron rings that had been
      sunk in the face of the cliff for the mooring of the fishing boats, he was
      more puzzled still. In another moment the girl was toiling up the little
      zig-zag track that led to the summit of the cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The track passed within a yard or two of the entrance to the cavern. He
      thought it advisable to step hack out of the moonlight, so that the girl
      should not see him. She was doubtless, he thought, on her way to the
      summit of the cliffs, and she would probably be startled if he were to
      appear suddenly before her eyes. He took a step or two back into the
      friendly shadow of the cavern, and waited to hear her footsteps on the
      track above him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited in vain. She did not take that zigzag track that led to the
      cliffs above the cave. He heard her jump&mdash;it was almost a feat&mdash;from
      the track by which she had ascended, on to a flat rock not a yard from the
      entrance to the cavern. He shrunk still further back into the darkness,
      and then there came before the entrance the most entrancing figure of a
      girl that he had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood there delightfully out of breath, with the moonlight bringing
      out every gracious curve in her shape. So he had seen the limelight reveal
      the graces of a breathless <i>danseuse</i>, when taking her &ldquo;call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Prince,&rdquo; said the girl, with many a gasp. &ldquo;You have treated me
      very badly. It&rsquo;s a pull&mdash;undeniably a pull&mdash;up those rocks, and
      for the third time I have kept my tryst with you, only to be
      disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and putting a shapely foot&mdash;she was by no means careful
      to conceal her stocking above the ankle&mdash;upon a stone, she quietly
      and in a matter-of-fact way, tied the lace of her yachting shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stooping was not good for her&mdash;he felt that, together with a few
      other matters incidental to her situation. He waited for the long breath
      he knew she would draw on straightening herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came. He hoped that her other shoe needed tying; but it did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her as she stood there with her back to him. She was sending
      her eyes out to the Western headlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my Prince; on the whole I&rsquo;m not disappointed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That
      picture repays me for my toil by sea and land. What a picture! But what
      would it be to be here with&mdash;with&mdash;love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought it was quite enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood there like a statue of white marble set among the black rocks.
      She was absolutely motionless for some minutes; and then the sigh that
      fluttered from her lips was, he knew, a different expression altogether
      from that which had come from her when she had straightened herself on
      fastening her shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father was a connoisseur in sighs; Harold did not profess to have the
      same amount of knowledge on the subject, but still he knew something. He
      could distinguish roughly on some points incidental to the sigh as a
      medium of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that little gasp which was not quite a gasp, she was again silent;
      then she whispered, but by no means gently, the one word &ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; and in
      another second she had sent her voice into the still night in a wild
      musical cry&mdash;such a cry as anyone gifted with that imaginative power
      which Brian had declared to be so necessary for archæological research,
      might attribute to the Banshee&mdash;the White Lady of Irish legends.
    </p>
    <p>
      She repeated the cry an octave higher and then she executed what is
      technically known as a &ldquo;scale&rdquo; but ended with that same weird cry of the
      Banshee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again she was breathless. Her blouse was turbulent just below her
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Brian does not cross himself until he feels more fatigue than he would
      after a pretence at rowing, I&rsquo;ll never play Banshee again,&rdquo; said the girl.
      &ldquo;<i>Ta, ta, mon Prince; a rivederci</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched her poise herself for the leap from the rock where she was
      standing, to the track&mdash;her grace was exquisite&mdash;it suggested
      that of the lithe antelope. The leap took her beyond his sight, and he did
      not venture immediately to a point whence he could regain possession of
      her with his eyes. But when he heard the sound of her voice singing a
      snatch of song&mdash;it was actually &ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;amour est un oiseau rebelle</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the
      Habanera from &ldquo;Carmen&rdquo;&mdash;he judged that she had reached the second
      angle of the zig-zag downward, and he took a step into the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she went, lilting the song and keeping time with her feet, until she
      reached the ledge where the boat was moored. She unfastened the painter,
      hauled the boat close, and he heard the sound of the plunge of the bows as
      she jumped on one of the beams, the force of her jump sending the boat far
      from shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat for some minutes on the beam amidship, listlessly allowing the
      boat to drift away from the rocks, then she put out her hands for the
      oars. Her right hand grasped one, but there was none for the left to
      grasp. Harold perceived that one of the oars had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the boat twenty yards from the rock drifting away beyond the
      control of the girl.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;ON THE HELPLESSNESS OF WOMAN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE girl had shown
      so much adroitness in the management of the little craft previously, he
      felt&mdash;with deep regret&mdash;that she would be quite equal to her
      present emergency. He was mistaken. She had reached the end of her
      resources in navigation when she had run the boat alongside the landing
      place. He saw&mdash;with great satisfaction&mdash;that with only one oar
      she was helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should he do?
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what he asked himself when he saw her dip her remaining oar into
      the water and paddle a few strokes, making the boat describe an awkward
      circle and bringing it perilously close to a jagged point of the reef that
      did duty as a natural breakwater for the mooring place of the boats. He
      came to the conclusion that if he allowed her to continue that sort of
      paddling, she would run the boat on the reef, and he would be morally
      responsible for the disaster and its consequences, whatever they might be.
      He had never felt more conscientious than at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran down the track to the landing ledge, but before he had reached the
      latter, the girl had ceased her efforts and was staring at him, her hands
      still resting on the oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an uneasy feeling that he was scarcely so picturesquely breathless
      as she had been, and this consciousness did not tend to make him fluent as
      he stood upon the rocky shelf not a foot above the ridges of the silver
      ripples.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself staring at her, just as she was staring at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite a minute had passed before he found words to ask her if he could be
      of any help to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied, in a tone very different from that in which
      she had spoken at the entrance to the cavern. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know. One of
      the oars must have gone overboard while the boat was moored. I scarcely
      know what I am to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re in a bad way!&rdquo; said he, shaking his head. The change in
      the girl&rsquo;s tone was very amusing to him. She had become quite demure; but
      previously, demureness had been in the background. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m afraid your
      case is a very bad one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So bad as that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps not quite, but still bad enough,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What do you
      want to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get home as soon as possible,&rdquo; she replied, without the pause of a
      second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tone was expressive. It conveyed to him the notion that she had just
      asked if he thought that she was an idiot. What could she want to do if
      not to go home?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I should advise you to take the oar to the
      sculling place in the centre of the stern. The boat is a stout one and
      will scull well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know how to scull,&rdquo; said she, in a tone of real distress;
      &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t think I can begin to learn just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If I were only aboard I could teach
      you in a short time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had begun her reply without the delay of a second, but she did not get
      beyond the one word. He felt that she did not need to do so: it was a
      sentence by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as you say, I&rsquo;m not aboard. Shall I get aboard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you?&rdquo; she inquired, brightening up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can swim,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The situation is not so desperate as that,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both laughed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped suddenly and looked up the cliffs to the Banshee&rsquo;s Cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she wondering if he had been within hearing when she had been&mdash;and
      not in silence&mdash;at the entrance to the cave?
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he had never seen so beautiful a girl. Even making a liberal
      allowance for that glamour of the moonlight, which he had tried to assure
      himself was as deceptive as the glamour of love, she was, he felt, the
      most beautiful girl he had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crushed down every suggestion that came to him as to the best way of
      helping her out of her difficulty. It was his opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned her eyes from the cliff and looked at him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something imploring in her look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep up your heart,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Whose boat is that, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It belongs to a man named Brian&mdash;Brian something or other&mdash;perhaps
      O&rsquo;Donal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I think it almost certain that you will find a fishing line
      in the locker astern&mdash;a fishing line and a tin bailer&mdash;the line
      will help you out of the difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he had quite done speaking she was in the stern sheets, groping
      with one hand in the little locker.
    </p>
    <p>
      She brought out, first, a small jar of whiskey, secondly, a small pannikin
      that served a man&rsquo;s purpose when he wished to drink the whiskey in
      unusually small quantities, and was also handy in bailing out the boat,
      and, thirdly, a fishing line-wound about a square frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held up the last-named so that Harold might see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it would be there,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now if you can only cast one end
      of that line ashore, I will catch it and the boat will be alongside the
      landing-place in a few minutes. Can you throw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent. She examined the hooks on the whale-bone cross-cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again, for he perceived that she was reluctant to boast of the
      possession of a skill which was denied to all womankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain to you what you must do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Cut away the cast of
      hooks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have no knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll throw mine into the bottom of your boat. Look out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being a man, he was able to make the knife alight within reasonable
      distance of the spot at which he aimed. He saw her face brighten as she
      picked up the implement and, opening it, quickly cut away the cast of
      hooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now make fast the leaden sinker to the end of the fishing line, unwind it
      all from the frame, and then whirl the weight round and sling it ashore&mdash;anywhere
      ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She followed his instructions implicitly, and the leaden weight fled
      through the air, with the sound of a shell from a mortar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well thrown!&rdquo; he cried, as it soared above his head; and it was well
      thrown&mdash;so well that it carried overboard every inch of the line and
      the frame to which it was attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stupid of me!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of me, you mean,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I should have told you to make it fast.
      However, no harm is done. I&rsquo;ll recover the weight and send it back to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had no trouble in effecting his purpose. He threw the weight as gently
      as possible into the bow of the boat, she picked it up, and the line was
      in her hands as he took in the slack and hauled the boat alongside the
      shelf of rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot have escaped notice that the system of hauling which he adopted
      had the result of bringing their hands together. They scarcely touched,
      however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said she, with profound coldness, when the boat was
      alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your case was not so desperate, after all,&rdquo; he remarked, with just a
      trifle less frigidity in his tone, though he now knew that she was the
      most beautiful girl he had ever seen. He had talked of the glamour of
      moonlight. How could he have been so ridiculous?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my case was not so very desperate,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Thank you so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Did she mean to suggest that he should now walk away?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go, you know, until I am satisfied that your <i>contretemps</i>
      is at an end,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My name is Wynne&mdash;Harold Wynne. I am a guest
      of Lord Innisfail&rsquo;s. I dare say you know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I know nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody here. Of course I daily hear something about Lord Innisfail and
      his guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Brian&mdash;he is somebody&mdash;the historian of the region.
      Did you ever hear the story of the Banshee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, but he flattered himself that his face told her nothing
      of what she seemed anxious to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, after a pause. &ldquo;I do believe that I heard the story of
      the Banshee&mdash;a princess, was she not&mdash;a sort of princess&mdash;an
      Irish princess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strictly Irish. It is said that the cry of the White Lady is sometimes
      heard even on these nights among the cliffs down which the Princess flung
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said she, turning her eyes to the sea. &ldquo;How strange!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange? well&mdash;perhaps. But Brian declares that he has heard the cry
      with his own ears. I have a friend who says, very coarsely, that if lies
      were landed property Brian would be the largest holder of real estate in
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend does not understand Brian.&rdquo; There was more than a trace of
      indignation in her voice. &ldquo;Brian has imagination&mdash;so have all the
      people about here. I must get home as soon as possible. I thank you very
      much for your trouble. Goodnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had no trouble. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took off his cap, and moved away&mdash;to the extent of a single step.
      She was still standing in the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said, as if the thought had just occurred to him; &ldquo;do you
      intend going overland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The glamour of the moonlight failed to conceal the troubled look that came
      to her eyes. He regained the step that he had taken away from her, and
      remarked, &ldquo;If you will be good enough to allow me, I will scull you with
      the one oar to any part of the coast that you may wish to reach. It would
      be a pleasure to me. I have nothing whatever to do. As a matter of fact, I
      don&rsquo;t see that you have any choice in the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; she said gravely. &ldquo;I was a fool&mdash;such a fool! But&mdash;the
      story of the Princess&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t make any confession to me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If I had not heard the
      story of the Princess, should I be here either?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;is Beatrice Avon. My father&rsquo;s name you may have
      heard&mdash;most people have heard his name, though I&rsquo;m afraid that not so
      many have read his books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have met your father,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If he is Julius Anthony Avon, I
      met him some years ago. He breakfasted with my tutor at Oxford. I have
      read all his hooks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come into the boat,&rdquo; she cried with a laugh. &ldquo;I feel that we have
      been introduced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so we have,&rdquo; said he, stepping upon the gunwale so as to push off the
      boat. &ldquo;Now, where is your best landing place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pointed out to him a white cottage at the entrance to a glen on the
      opposite coast of the lough, just below the ruins&mdash;they could be seen
      by the imaginative eye&mdash;of the Castle of Carrigorm. The cottage was
      glistening in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is where we have been living&mdash;my father and I&mdash;for the
      past month,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He is engaged on a new work&mdash;a History of
      Irish Patriotism, and he has begun by compiling a biographical dictionary
      of Irish Informers. He is making capital progress with it. He has already
      got to the end of the seventh volume and he has very nearly reached the
      letter C&mdash;oh, yes, he is making rapid progress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why is he at this place? Is he working up the Irish legends as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that the French landed here some time or other, and that was the
      beginning of a new era of rebellions. My father is dealing with the
      period, and means to have his topography strictly accurate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Harold, &ldquo;if he carefully avoids everything that he is told in
      Ireland his book may tend to accuracy.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER X.&mdash;ON SCIENCE AND ART.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> BOAT being urged
      onwards&mdash;not very rapidly&mdash;by a single oar resting in a hollow
      in the centre of the stern, and worked from side to side by a man in
      evening dress, is not a sight of daily occurrence. This may have suggested
      itself to the girl who was seated on the midship beam; but if she was
      inclined to laugh, she succeeded in controlling her impulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found that he was more adroit at the science of marine propulsion than
      he had fancied he was. The boat was making quite too rapid progress for
      his desires, across the lough.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked the girl if she did not think it well that she should become
      acquainted with at least the scientific principle which formed the basis
      of the marine propeller. It was extremely unlikely that such an emergency
      as that which had lately arisen should ever again make a demand upon her
      resources, but if such were ever to present itself, it might be well for
      her to be armed to overcome it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she said, it was extremely unlikely that she should ever again be so
      foolish, and she hoped that her father would not be uneasy at her failure
      to return at the hour at which she had told him to expect her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped rocking the oar from side to side in order to assure her that
      she could not possibly be delayed more than a quarter of an hour through
      the loss of the oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said that she was very glad, and that she really thought that the boat
      was making more rapid progress with his one oar than it had done in the
      opposite direction with her two oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to perceive that his opportunities of making her acquainted with
      the science of the screw propeller were dwindling. He faced the oar
      boldly, however, and he felt that he had at least succeeded in showing her
      how effective was the application of a scientific law to the achievement
      of his end&mdash;assuming that that end was the driving of the boat
      through the waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a fool. He knew very well that there is nothing which so
      appeals to the interest of a woman as seeing a man do something that she
      cannot do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after five minutes&rsquo; work, he turned his head to steer the boat, he
      found that she was watching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had previously been watching the white glistening cottage, with the
      light in one window only.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of his observation was extremely satisfactory to him. He
      resumed his toil without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was how it happened that the boat made so excellent a passage
      across the lough.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the keel grated upon the sand that the girl spoke. She
      made a splendid leap from the bows, and, turning, asked him if he would
      care to pay a visit to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied that he feared that he might jeopardize the biography of some
      interesting informer whose name might occur at the close of the letter B.
      He hoped that he would be allowed to borrow the boat for his return to the
      cliffs, and to row it back the next day to where it was at the moment he
      was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      His earnest sculling of the boat had not made all thought for the morrow
      impracticable. He had been reflecting through the silence, how he might
      make the chance of meeting once more this girl whose face he had seen for
      the first time half an hour before.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had already given him an absurd amount of trouble, she said. The boat
      was one that she had borrowed from Brian, and Brian could easily row it
      across next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he happened to know that Brian was to be in attendance on Mr. Durdan
      all the next day. Mr. Durdan had come to the West solely for the purpose
      of studying the Irish question on the spot. He had, consequently, spent
      all his time, deep-sea fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you perceive that there&rsquo;s nothing for it but for me to bring back the
      boat, Miss Avon,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do it so well,&rdquo; she said, with a tone of enthusiasm in her voice. &ldquo;I
      never admired anything so much&mdash;your sculling, I mean. And perhaps I
      may learn something about&mdash;was it the scientific principle that you
      were kind enough to offer to teach me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scientific principle,&rdquo; said he, with an uneasy feeling that the girl
      had seen through his artifice to prolong the crossing of the lough. &ldquo;Yes,
      you certainly should know all about the scientific principle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel so, indeed. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said he, preparing to push the boat off the sand where it
      had grounded. &ldquo;Goodnight. By the way, it was only when we were out with
      Brian in the afternoon that he told us the story of the Princess and her
      lover. He added that the cry of the White Lady would probably be heard
      when night came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you may hear it yet,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had run up the sandy beach, before he had pushed off the boat, and she
      never looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood with one foot on the gunwale of the boat in act to push into deep
      water, thinking that perhaps she might at the last moment look round.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught another glimpse of her beyond the furze that crowned a ridge of
      rocks. But she had her face steadfastly set toward the white cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw all his weight upon the oar which he was using as a pole, and out
      the boat shot into the deep water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; said Edmund Airey. &ldquo;Where have you been for the past
      couple of hours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; repeated Miss Craven in a tone of voice that should only be
      assumed when the eyes, of the speaker are sparkling. But Miss Craven&rsquo;s
      eyes were not sparkling. Their strong point was not in that direction.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you must give an account of yourself, Mr. Wynne,&rdquo; she
      continued. She was standing by the side of Edmund Airey, within the
      embrace of the mighty antlers of the ancient elk in the hall. The sound of
      dance music was in the air, and Miss Craven&rsquo;s face was flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give an account of myself would be to place myself on a level of
      dulness with the autobiographers whose reminiscences we yawn over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then give us a chance of yawning,&rdquo; cried Miss Craven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not need one,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Have you not been for some time by the
      side of a Member of Parliament?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been over the cliffs,&rdquo; suggested the Member of Parliament. He was
      looking at Harold&rsquo;s shoes, which bore tokens of having been ill-treated
      beyond the usual ill-treatment of shoes with bows of ribbon above the
      toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;Over the cliffs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Banshee&rsquo;s Cave, I&rsquo;m certain,&rdquo; said Miss Craven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, at the Banshee&rsquo;s Cave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely! And you saw the White Lady?&rdquo; she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw the White Lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you heard her cry at the entrance to the cave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I heard her cry at the entrance to the cave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Utter nonsense!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I must ask Lady Innisfail to dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the hall to where Lady Innisfail was seated. She was fanning
      herself and making sparkling replies to the inanities of Mr. Durdan, who
      stood beside her. She had been engaged in every dance, Harold knew, from
      the extra gravity of her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo; Miss Craven asked of Edmund Airey in a low&mdash;almost
      an anxious, tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean? Why, to dance with Lady Innisfail. He is a man of determination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean by that nonsense about the Banshee&rsquo;s Cave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it nonsense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is. Does anyone suppose that the legend of the White Lady is
      anything but nonsense? Didn&rsquo;t you ridicule it at dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At dinner; oh, yes: but then you must remember that no one is altogether
      discreet at dinner. That cold <i>entrée</i>&mdash;the Russian salad&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good many people are discreet neither at dinner nor after it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend Harold, for instance? Oh, I have every confidence in him. I
      know his mood. I have experienced it myself. I, too, have stood in a
      sculpturesque attitude and attire, on a rock overhanging a deep sea, and I
      have been at the point of dressing again without taking the plunge that I
      meant to take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that he&mdash;that he&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that if he had been so fortunate as to come upon you suddenly at
      the Banshee&rsquo;s Cave or wherever he was to-night, he would have&mdash;well,
      he would have taken the plunge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw the girl&rsquo;s face become slightly roseate in spite of the fact of her
      being the most self-controlled person whom he had ever met. He perceived
      that she appreciated his meaning to a shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked that. A man who is gifted with the power of expressing his ideas
      in various shades, likes to feel that his power is appreciated. He knew
      that there are some people who fancy that every question is susceptible of
      being answered by yea or nay. He hated such people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The plunge?&rdquo; said Miss Craven, with an ingenuousness that confirmed his
      high estimate of her powers of appreciation. &ldquo;The plunge? But the
      Banshee&rsquo;s Cave is a hundred feet above the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But men have taken headers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and therefore we should finish our waltz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did finish their waltz.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;ON HEAVEN AND THE LORD CHANCELLOR.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>R. DURDAN was
      explaining something&mdash;he usually was explaining something. When he
      had been a member of the late Government his process of explaining
      something was generally regarded as a fine effort at mystification. In
      private his explanations were sometimes intelligible. As Harold entered
      the room where a straggling breakfast was proceeding&mdash;everything
      except dinner had a tendency to be straggling at Castle Innisfail&mdash;Mr.
      Dur dan was explaining how Brian had been bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a profitable theme, especially for a man who fondly believed that
      he had the power of reproducing what he imagined to be the Irish brogue of
      the boatman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold gathered that Mr. Durdan had already had a couple of hours of
      deep-sea fishing in the boat with Brian&mdash;the servants were all the
      morning carrying into the dining-room plates of fish of his catching
      (audibly sneered at by the fly-fishers, who considered their supreme
      failures superior to the hugest successes of the deep-sea fishers).
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fishing was not to the point. What Mr. Durdan believed to be very
      much to the point were the &ldquo;begorras,&rdquo; the &ldquo;acushlas,&rdquo; the &ldquo;arrahs&rdquo; which
      he tried to make his auditors believe the boatman had uttered in telling
      him how he had been awakened early in the night by hearing the cry of the
      Banshee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every phrase supposed to have been employed by the boatman was reproduced
      by the narrator; and his auditors glanced meaningly at one another. It
      would have required a great deal of convincing to make them fancy for a
      moment that the language of Brian consisted of an imaginary Irish
      exclamation preceding a purely Cockney&mdash;occasionally Yorkshire&mdash;idiom.
      But the narrator continued his story, and seemed convinced that his voice
      was an exact reproduction of Brian&rsquo;s brogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold thought that he would try a little of something that was not fish&mdash;he
      scarcely minded what he had, provided it was not fish, he told the
      servant. And as there was apparently some little-difficulty in procuring
      such a comestible, Harold drank some coffee and listened to Mr. Durdan&rsquo;s
      story&mdash;he recommenced it for everyone who entered the breakfast-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Brian had distinctly heard the cry of the Banshee, he said; but a
      greater marvel had happened, for he found one of his boats that had been
      made fast on the opposite shore of the lough in the early part of the
      night, moored at the landing-ledge at the base of the cliffs beneath the
      Banshee&rsquo;s Cave. By the aid of many a gratuitous &ldquo;begorra,&rdquo; Mr. Durdan
      indicated the condition of perplexity in which the boatman had been all
      the time he was baiting the lines. He explained that the man had
      attributed to &ldquo;herself&rdquo;&mdash;meaning, of course, the White Lady&mdash;the
      removal of the boat from the one side of the lough to the other. It was
      plain that the ghost of the Princess was a good oarswoman, too, for a
      single paddle only was found in the boat. It was so like a ghost, he had
      confided to Mr. Durdan, to make a cruise in a way that was contrary&mdash;the
      accent on the second syllable&mdash;to nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has put another oar aboard and is now rowing the boat back to its
      original quarters,&rdquo; said Mr. Durdan, in conclusion. &ldquo;But he declares that,
      be the Powers!&rdquo;&mdash;here the narrator assumed once more the hybrid
      brogue&mdash;&ldquo;if the boat was meddled with by &lsquo;herself&rsquo; again he would
      call the priest to bless the craft, and where would &lsquo;herself&rsquo; be then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where indeed?&rdquo; said Lord Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold said nothing. He was aware that Edmund was looking at him intently.
      Did he suspect anything, Harold wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave no indication of being more interested in the story than anyone
      present, and no one present seemed struck with it&mdash;no one, except
      perhaps, Miss Craven, who had entered the room late, and was thus
      fortunate enough to obtain the general drift of what Mr. Durdan was
      talking about, without having her attention diverted by his loving
      repetition of the phrases of local colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Craven heard the story, laughed, glanced at her plate, and remarked
      with some slyness that Mr. Durdan was clearly making strides in his
      acquaintance with the Irish question. She then glanced&mdash;confidentially&mdash;at
      Edmund Airey, and finally&mdash;rather less confidentially&mdash;at
      Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was eating of that which was not fish, and giving a good deal of
      attention to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Craven thought he was giving quite too much attention to it. She
      suspected that he knew more about the boat incident than he cared to
      express, or why should he be giving so much attention to his plate?
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Harold himself, he was feeling that it would be something of a
      gratification to him if a fatal accident were to happen to Brian.
    </p>
    <p>
      He inwardly called him a meddlesome fool. Why should he take it upon him
      to row the boat across the lough, when he, Harold, had been looking
      forward during the sleepless hours of the night, to that exercise? When he
      had awakened from an early morning slumber, it was with the joyous feeling
      that nothing could deprive him of that row across the lough.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet he had been deprived of it, therefore he felt some regret that,
      the morning being a calm one, Brian&rsquo;s chances of disaster when crossing
      the lough were insignificant.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the time that the judge was explaining in that lucid style which was
      the envy of his brethren on the Bench, how impossible it would be for the
      Son of Porcupine to purge himself of the contempt which was heaped upon
      him owing to his unseemly behaviour at a recent race meeting&mdash;the
      case of the son of so excellent a father as Porcupine turning out badly
      was jeopardizing the future of Evolution as a doctrine&mdash;Harold was
      trying to devise some plan that should make him independent of the
      interference of the boatman. He did not insist on the plan being
      legitimate or even reasonable; all that he felt was that he must cross the
      lough.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of the girl whom he had seen in that atmosphere of moonlight;
      and somehow he came to think of her as responsible for her exquisite
      surroundings. There was nothing commonplace about her&mdash;that was what
      he felt most strongly as he noticed the excellent appetites of the young
      women around him. Even Miss Stafford, who hoped to be accepted as an
      Intellect embodied in a mere film of flesh&mdash;she went to the extreme
      length of cultivating a Brow&mdash;tickled her trout with the point of her
      fork much less tenderly than the fisherman who told her the story&mdash;with
      an impromptu bravura passage or two&mdash;of its capture, had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl whom he had seen in the moonlight&mdash;whom he was yearning
      to see in the sunlight&mdash;was as refined as a star. &ldquo;As refined as a
      star,&rdquo; he actually murmured, when he found himself with an unlighted cigar
      between his fingers on that part of the terrace which afforded a fine view
      of the lough&mdash;the narrow part as well&mdash;his eyes were directed to
      the narrow part. &ldquo;As refined as a star&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned himself round with a jerk. &ldquo;A star?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His father&rsquo;s letter was still in his pocket. It contained in the course of
      its operatic clauses some references to a Star&mdash;a Star, who, alas!
      was not refined&mdash;who, on the contrary, was expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck a match very viciously and lit his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Craven had just appeared on the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped his still flaming match on the hard gravel walk and put his
      foot upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A star!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was very vicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not a particularly good talker, but she is a most fascinating
      listener,&rdquo; said Edmund Airey, who strolled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have noticed so much&mdash;when you have been the talker,&rdquo; said Harold.
      &ldquo;It is only to the brilliant talker that the fascinating listener appeals.
      By the way, how does &lsquo;fascinated listener&rsquo; sound as a phrase? Haven&rsquo;t I
      read somewhere that the speeches of an eminent politician were modelled on
      the principle of catching birds by night? You flash a lamp upon them and
      they may be captured by the score. The speeches were compared to the
      lantern and the public to the birds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gulls,&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;My dear Harold, I did not come out here to exchange
      opinions with you on the vexed question of vote-catching or gulls&mdash;it
      will be time enough to do so when you have found a constituency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. And meantime I am to think of Miss Craven as a fascinating
      listener? That&rsquo;s what you have come to impress upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that you should give yourself a fair chance of becoming acquainted
      with her powers as a listener&mdash;I mean that you should talk to her on
      an interesting topic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to heaven that I had your capacity of being interesting on all
      topics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dullest man on earth when talking to a woman on love as a topic, is
      infinitely more interesting to her than the most brilliant man when
      talking to her on any other topic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suggest a perilous way to the dull man of becoming momentarily
      interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know the phrase which, in spite of being the composition of a
      French philosopher, is not altogether devoid of truth&mdash;yes, &lsquo;<i>Qui
      parle d&rsquo;amour fait l&rsquo;amour&rsquo;&rsquo;</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that love is born, not made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens! have you learned that&mdash;that, with your father&rsquo;s
      letter next your heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you fancy that I have forgotten your conversation in the boat
      yesterday?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Heaven on one side and the Lord Chancellor on the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have come to the conclusion that you are on the side of heaven?
      You are in a perilous way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your logic is a trifle shaky, friend. Besides, you have no right to
      assume that I am on the side of heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a suggestion of indignation in your voice that gives me hope
      that you are not in so evil a case as I may have suspected. Do you think
      that another afternoon in the boat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would make me on the side of the Lord Chancellor? I doubt it. But that is
      not equivalent to saying that I doubt the excellence of your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday afternoon I flattered myself that I had given you such advice
      as commended itself to you, and yet now you tell me that love is born, not
      made. The man who believes that is past being advised. It is, I say, the
      end of wisdom. What has happened since yesterday afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing has happened to shake my confidence in the soundness of your
      advice,&rdquo; said Harold, but not until a pause had occurred&mdash;a pause of
      sufficient duration to tell his observant friend that something had
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If nothing has happened&mdash;Miss Craven is going to sketch the Round
      Tower at noon,&rdquo; said Edmund&mdash;the Round Tower was some distance
      through the romantic Pass of Lamdhu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Round Tower will not suffer; Miss Craven is not one of the landscape
      libellers,&rdquo; remarked Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Miss Innisfail hurried up with a face lined with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Innisfail was the sort of girl who always, says, &ldquo;It is I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Airey,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I have come to entreat of you to do your best
      to dissuade mamma from her wild notion&mdash;the wildest she has ever had.
      You may have some restraining influence upon her. She is trying to get up
      an Irish jig in the hall after dinner&mdash;she has set her heart on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can promise you that if Lady Innisfail asks me to be one of the
      performers I shall decline,&rdquo; said Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she has set her heart on bringing native dancers for the purpose,&rdquo;
       cried the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds serious,&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;Native dances are usually very
      terrible visitations. I saw one at Samoa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it&mdash;yes, I suspected as much,&rdquo; murmured the girl, shaking her
      head. &ldquo;Oh, we must put a stop to it. You will help me, Mr. Airey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am always on the side of law and order,&rdquo; said Mr. Airey. &ldquo;A mother is a
      great responsibility, Miss Innisfail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Innisfail smiled sadly, shook her head again, and fled to find
      another supporter against the latest frivolity of her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Edmund turned about from watching her, he saw that his friend Harold
      Wynne had gone off with some of the yachtsmen&mdash;for every day a
      yachting party as well as deep-sea-fishing, and salmon-fishing parties&mdash;shooting
      parties and even archæological parties were in the habit of setting-out
      from Castle Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that Harold intended spending the day aboard the cutter,
      Edmund asked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold&rsquo;s mood of the previous evening had been quite intelligible to him&mdash;he
      had confessed to Miss Craven that he understood and even sympathized with
      him. He was the man who was putting off the plunge as long as possible, he
      felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he knew that that attitude, if prolonged, not only becomes ridiculous,
      but positively verges on the indecent. It is one thing to pause for a
      minute on the brink of the deep water, and quite another to remain
      shivering on the rock for half a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold Wynne wanted money in order to realize a legitimate ambition. But
      it so happened that he could not obtain that money unless by marrying Miss
      Craven&mdash;that was the situation of the moment. But instead of asking
      Miss Craven if she would have the goodness to marry him, he was wandering
      about the coast in an aimless way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail was the most finished artist in matchmaking that Edmund had
      ever met. So finished an artist was she that no one had ever ventured to
      suggest that she was a match-maker. As a matter of fact, her reputation
      lay in just the opposite direction. She was generally looked upon as a
      marrer of matches. This was how she had achieved some of her most
      brilliant successes. She was herself so fascinating that she attracted the
      nicest men to her side; but, somehow, instead of making love to her as
      they meant to do, they found themselves making love to the nice girls with
      whom she surrounded herself. When running upon the love-making track with
      her, she switched them on, so to speak, to the nice eligible girls, and
      they became engaged before they quite knew what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was her art, Edmund knew, and he appreciated it as it deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      She appreciated him as he deserved, he also acknowledged; for she had
      never tried to switch him on to any of her girls. By never making love to
      her he had proved himself to be no fit subject for the exercise of her
      art.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a man truly loves a woman he will marry anyone whom she asks him to
      marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, he knew, was the precept that Lady Innisfail inculcated upon the
      young men&mdash;they were mostly very young men&mdash;who assured her that
      they adored her. It rarely failed to bring them to their senses, she had
      admitted to Edmund in the course of a confidential lapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      By bringing them to their senses she meant inducing them to ask the right
      girls to marry them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund felt that it was rather a pity that his friend Harold had never
      adored Lady Innisfail. Harold had always liked her too well to make love
      to her. This was rather a pity, Edmund felt. It practically disarmed Lady
      Innisfail, otherwise she would have taken care that he made
      straightforward love to Miss Craven.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Harold, he strolled off with the yachtsmen, giving them to
      understand that he intended sailing with them. The cutter was at her
      moorings in the lough about a mile from the Castle, and there was a narrow
      natural dock between the cliffs into which the dingey ran to carry the
      party out to the yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that Harold separated himself from the yachtsmen&mdash;not
      without some mutterings on their part and the delivery of a few reproaches
      with a fresh maritime flavour about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was he up to at all?&rdquo; they asked of one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could scarcely have told these earnest inquirers what he was up to. But
      his mood would have been quite intelligible to them had they known that he
      had, within the past half hour made up his mind to let nothing interfere
      with his asking Helen Craven if she would be good enough to marry him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;ON THE MYSTERY OF MAN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E meant to ask her
      at night. He had felt convinced, on returning after his adventure in his
      dinner dress, that nothing could induce him to think of Miss Craven as a
      possible wife. While sitting at breakfast, he had felt even more confident
      on this point; and yet now his mind was made up to ask her to marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be admitted that his mood was a singular one, especially as, with
      his mind full of his resolution to ask Miss Craven to marry him, he was
      wandering around the rugged coastway, wondering by what means he could
      bring himself by the side of the girl with whom he had crossed the lough
      on the previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mood will be intelligible to such persons as have had friends who
      occasionally have found it necessary to their well-being to become
      teetotallers. It is well known that the fascination of the prospect of
      teetotalism is so great for such persons that the very thought of it
      compels them to rush off in the opposite direction. They indulge in an
      outburst of imbibing that makes even their best friends stand aghast, and
      then they &lsquo;take the pledge&rsquo; with the cheerfulness of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold Wynne felt inclined to allow his feelings an outburst, previous to
      entering upon a condition in which he meant his feelings to be kept in
      subjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      To engage himself to marry Miss Craven was, he believed, equivalent to
      taking the pledge of the teetotaller so far as his feelings were
      concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, however, he remained unpledged and with an unbounded sense of
      freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was why he laughed loud and long when he saw in the course of his
      stroll around the cliffs, a small oar jammed in a crevice of the rocks a
      hundred feet below where he was walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again when he had gone&mdash;not so cautiously as he might have
      done&mdash;down to the crevice and released the oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, he knew, the one that had gone adrift from the boat the previous
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed the cliff to the Banshee&rsquo;s Cave and deposited the piece of
      timber in the recesses of that place. Then he lay down on the coarse
      herbage at the summit of the cliff until it was time to drift to the
      Castle for lunch. Life at the Castle involved a good deal of drifting. The
      guests drifted out in many directions after breakfast and occasionally
      drifted back to lunch, after which they drifted about until the dinner
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      While taking lunch he was in such good spirits as made Lady Innisfail
      almost hopeless of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund Airey had told her the previous night that Harold intended asking
      Miss Craven to marry him. Now, however, perceiving how excellent were his
      spirits, she looked reproachfully across the table at Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was mutely asking him&mdash;and he knew it&mdash;how it was possible
      to reconcile Harold&rsquo;s good spirits with his resolution to ask Helen Craven
      to marry him? She knew&mdash;and so did Edmund&mdash;that high spirits and
      the Resolution are rarely found in association.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after lunch the girl with the Brow entreated Harold&rsquo;s critical
      opinion on the subject of a gesture in the delivery of a certain poem, and
      the discussion of the whole question occupied another hour. The afternoon
      was thus pretty far advanced before he found himself seated alone in the
      boat which had been at the disposal of himself and Edmund during the two
      previous afternoons. The oar that he had picked up was lying at his feet
      along the timbers of the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was within an hour of setting when Brian appeared at the Castle
      bearing a letter for Lady Innisfail. It had been entrusted to him for
      delivery to her ladyship by Mr. Wynne, he said. Where was Mr. Wynne? That
      Brian would not take upon him to say; only he was at the opposite side of
      the lough. Maybe he was with Father Conn, who was the best of good
      company, or it wasn&rsquo;t a bit unlikely that it was the District Inspector of
      the Constabulary he was with. Anyhow it was sure that the gentleman had
      took a great fancy to the queer places along the coast, for hadn&rsquo;t he been
      to the thrubble to give a look in at the Banshee&rsquo;s Cave, the previous
      night, just because he was sthruck with admiration of the story of the
      Princess that he, Brian, had told him and Mr. Airey in the boat?
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter that Lady Innisfail received and glanced at while drinking tea
      on one of the garden seats outside the Castle, begged her ladyship to
      pardon the writer&rsquo;s not appearing at dinner that night, the fact being
      that he had unexpectedly found an old friend who had taken possession of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very nice of him to write, wasn&rsquo;t it, my dear?&rdquo; Lady Innisfail
      remarked to her friend Miss Craven, who was filtering a novel by a popular
      French author for the benefit of Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;It was very nice of him
      to write. Of course that about the friend is rubbish. The charm of this
      neighbourhood is that no old friend ever turns up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that&mdash;that&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; suggested Miss
      Craven with the infinite delicacy of one who has been employed in the
      filtration of Paul Bourget.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all&mdash;not at all,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail, shaking her head. &ldquo;If
      it was his father it would be quite another matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Fotheringay is too great a responsibility even for me, and I don&rsquo;t
      as a rule shirk such things,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;But Harold is&mdash;well,
      I&rsquo;ll let you into a secret, though it is against myself: he has never made
      love even to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is inexcusable,&rdquo; remarked Miss Craven, with a little movement of the
      eyebrows. She did not altogether appreciate Lady Innisfail&rsquo;s systems. She
      had not a sufficient knowledge of dynamics and the transference of energy
      to be able to understand the beauty of the &ldquo;switch&rdquo; principle. &ldquo;But if he
      is not with a friend&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;the other&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The enemy&mdash;our enemy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can he be&mdash;where can he have been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows! There are some things that are too wonderful for me. I
      fancied long ago that I knew Man. My dear Helen, I was a fool. Man is a
      mystery. What could that boy mean by going to the Banshee&rsquo;s Cave last
      night, when he might have been dancing with me&mdash;or you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Romance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Romance and rubbish mean the same thing to such men as Harold Wynne,
      Helen&mdash;you should know so much,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;That is, of
      course, romance in the abstract. The flutter of a human white frock would
      produce more impression on a man than a whole army of Banshees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet the boatman said that Mr. Wynne had spent some time last night at
      the Cave,&rdquo; said Miss Craven. &ldquo;Was there a white dress in the question, do
      you fancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail turned her large and luminous eyes upon her companion. So
      she was accustomed to turn those orbs upon such young men as declared that
      they adored her. The movement was supposed to be indicative of infinite
      surprise, with abundant sympathy, and a trace of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen Craven met the luminous gaze with a smile, that broadened as she
      murmured, &ldquo;Dearest Lilian, we are quite alone. It is extremely unlikely
      that your expression can be noticed by any of the men. It is practically
      wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the natural and reasonable expression of the surprise I feel at the
      wisdom of the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serpent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite. Let us say, the young matron, lurking beneath the harmlessness
      of the&mdash;the&mdash;let us say the <i>ingenue</i>. A white dress! Pray
      go on with &lsquo;<i>Un Cour de Femme&rsquo;.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Craven picked up the novel which had been on the ground, flattened
      out in a position of oriental prostration and humility before the wisdom
      of the women.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;ON THE ART OF COLOURING.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE people of the
      village of Ballycruiskeen showed themselves quite ready to enter into the
      plans of their pastor in the profitable enterprise of making entertainment
      for Lady Innisfail and her guests. The good pastor had both enterprise and
      imagination. Lady Innisfail had told him confidentially that day that she
      wished to impress her English visitors with the local colour of the region
      round about. Local colour was a phrase that she was as fond of as if she
      had been an art critic; but it so happened that the pastor had never heard
      the phrase before; he promptly assured her, however, that he sympathized
      most heartily with her ladyship&rsquo;s aspirations in this direction. Yes, it
      was absolutely necessary that they should be impressed with the local
      colour, and if, with this impression, there came an appreciation of the
      requirements of the chapel in the way of a new roof, it would please him
      greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roof would certainly be put on before the winter, even if the work had
      to be carried out at the expense of his Lordship, Lady Innisfail said with
      enthusiasm; and if Father Constantine could only get up a wake or a dance
      or some other festivity for the visitors, just to show them how
      picturesque and sincere were the Irish race in the West, she would take
      care that the work on the roof was begun without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Constantine&mdash;he hardly knew himself by that name, having
      invariably been called Father Conn by his flock&mdash;began to have a
      comprehensive knowledge of what was meant by the phrase &ldquo;local colour.&rdquo;
       Did her ladyship insist on a wake, he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship said she had no foolish prejudices in the matter. She was
      quite willing to leave the whole question of the entertainment in the
      hands of his reverence. He knew the people best and he would be able to
      say in what direction their abilities could be exhibited to the greatest
      advantage. She had always had an idea, she confessed, that it was at a
      wake they shone; but, of course, if Father Constantine thought differently
      she would make no objection, but she would dearly like a wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest did not even smile for more than a minute; but he could not
      keep that twinkle out of his eyes even if the chapel walls in addition to
      the roof depended on his self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      He assured her ladyship that she was perfectly right in her ideas. He
      agreed with her that the wake was the one festivity that was calculated to
      bring into prominence the varied talents of his flock. But the unfortunate
      thing about it was its variableness. A wake was something that could not
      be arranged for beforehand&mdash;at least not without involving a certain
      liability to criminal prosecution. The elements of a wake were simple
      enough, to be sure, but simple and all as they were, they were not always
      forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail thought this very provoking. Of course, expense was no
      consideration&mdash;she hoped that the pastor understood so much. She
      hoped he understood that if he could arrange for a wake that night she
      would bear the expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then, if a wake was absolutely out of the question&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t
      see why it should be, but, of course, he knew best&mdash;why should he not
      get up an eviction? She thought that on the whole the guests had latterly
      heard more about Irish evictions than Irish wakes. There was plenty of
      local colour in an eviction, and so far as she could gather from the
      pictures she had seen in the illustrated papers, it was extremely
      picturesque&mdash;yes, when the girls were barefooted, and when there was
      active resistance. Hadn&rsquo;t she heard something about boiling water?
    </p>
    <p>
      The twinkle had left the priest&rsquo;s eyes as she prattled away. He had an
      impulse to tell her that it was the class to which her ladyship belonged
      and not that to which he belonged, who had most practice in that form of
      entertainment known as the eviction. But thinking of the chapel roof, he
      restrained himself. After all, Lord Innisfail had never evicted a family
      on his Irish estate. He had evicted several families on his English
      property, however; but no one ever makes a fuss about English evictions.
      If people fail to pay their rent in England they know that they must go.
      They have not the imagination of the Irish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell your ladyship what it is,&rdquo; said Father Conn, before she had
      quite come to the end of her prattle: &ldquo;if the ladies and gentlemen who
      have the honour to be your ladyship&rsquo;s guests will take the trouble to walk
      or drive round the coast to the Curragh of Lamdhu after supper&mdash;I
      mean dinner&mdash;to-night, I&rsquo;ll get up a celebration of the Cruiskeen for
      you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful!&rdquo; exclaimed her ladyship. &ldquo;And what might a celebration of
      the Cruiskeen be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that the imagination of the good father came to his
      assistance. He explained, with a volubility that comes to the Celt only
      when he is romancing, that the celebration of the Cruiskeen was a
      prehistoric rite associated with the village of Ballycruiskeen. Cruiskeen
      was, as perhaps her ladyship had heard, the Irish for a vessel known to
      common people as a jug&mdash;it was, he explained, a useful vessel for
      drinking out of&mdash;when it held a sufficient quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Lady Innisfail had heard of a jug&mdash;she had even heard of a
      song called &ldquo;The Cruiskeen Lawn&rdquo;&mdash;did that mean some sort of jug?
    </p>
    <p>
      It meant the little full jug, his reverence assured her. Anyhow, the
      celebration of the Cruiskeen of Ballycruiskeen had taken place for
      hundreds&mdash;most likely thousands&mdash;of years at the Curragh of
      Lamdhu&mdash;Lamdhu meaning the Black Hand&mdash;and it was perhaps the
      most interesting of Irish customs. Was it more interesting than a wake?
      Why, a wake couldn&rsquo;t hold a candle to a Cruiskeen, and the display of
      candles was, as probably her ladyship knew, a distinctive feature of a
      wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Conn, finding how much imaginary archæology Lady Innisfail would
      stand without a protest, then allowed his imagination to revel in the
      details of harpers&mdash;who were much more genteel than fiddlers, he
      thought, though his flock preferred the fiddle&mdash;of native dances and
      of the recitals of genuine Irish poems&mdash;probably prehistoric. All
      these were associated with a Cruiskeen, he declared, and a Cruiskeen her
      ladyship and her ladyship&rsquo;s guests should have that night, if there was
      any public spirit left in Ballycruiskeen, and he rather thought that there
      was a good deal still left, thank God!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail was delighted. Local colour! Why, this entertainment was a
      regular Winsor and Newton Cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It included everything that people in England were accustomed to associate
      with the Irish, and this was just what the guests would relish. It was
      infinitely more promising than the simple national dance for which she had
      been trying to arrange.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook Father Conn heartily by the hand, but stared at him when he made
      some remark about the chapel roof&mdash;she had already forgotten all
      about the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive me for my romancing!&rdquo; he murmured, when her ladyship had
      departed and he stood wiping his forehead. &ldquo;God forgive me! If it wasn&rsquo;t
      for the sake of the slate or two, the ne&rsquo;er a word but the blessed truth
      would have been forced from me. A Cruiskeen! How was it that the notion
      seized me at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried off to an ingenious friend and confidential adviser of his,
      whose name was O&rsquo;Flaherty, and who did a little in the horse-dealing line&mdash;a
      profession that tends to develop the ingenuity of those associated with it
      either as buyers or sellers&mdash;and Mr. O&rsquo;Flaherty, after hearing Father
      Conn&rsquo;s story, sat down on the side of one of the ditches, which are such a
      distinctive feature of Ballycruiskeen and the neighbourhood, and roared
      with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve done it this time, and no mistake, Father Conn,&rdquo; he cried, when he
      had partially recovered from his hilarity. &ldquo;I always said you&rsquo;d do it some
      day, and ye&rsquo;ve done it now. A Cruiskeen! Mother of Moses! A Cruiskeen! Oh,
      but it&rsquo;s yourself has the quare head, Father Conn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give over your fun, and tell us what&rsquo;s to be done&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
      you&rsquo;re to do if there&rsquo;s any good in you at all,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by my soul, ye&rsquo;ll have to carry out the enterprise in your own way,
      my brave Father Conn,&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Flaherty. &ldquo;A Cruiskeen! A&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phinny O&rsquo;Flaherty,&rdquo; said the priest solemnly, &ldquo;if ye don&rsquo;t want to have
      the curse of the Holy Church flung at that red head of yours, ye&rsquo;ll rise
      and put me on the way of getting up at least a jig or two on the Curragh
      this night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After due consideration Mr. O&rsquo;Flaherty came to the conclusion that it
      would be unwise on his part to put in motion the terrible machinery of the
      Papal Interdict&mdash;if the forces of the Vatican were to be concentrated
      upon him he might never again be able to dispose of a &ldquo;roarer&rdquo; as merely a
      &ldquo;whistler&rdquo; to someone whose suspicions were susceptible of being lulled by
      a brogue. Mr. Phineas O&rsquo;Flaherty consequently assured Father Conn that he
      would help his reverence, even if the act should jeopardize his prospects
      of future happiness in another world.

      CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;ON AN IRISH DANCE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ADY INNISFAIL&rsquo;S
      guests&mdash;especially those who had been wandering over the mountains
      with guns all day&mdash;found her rather too indefatigable in her search
      for new methods of entertaining them. The notion of an after-dinner stroll
      of a few miles to the village of Ballycruiskeen for the sake of witnessing
      an entertainment, the details of which Lady Innisfail was unable to do
      more than suggest, and the attractions of which were rather more than
      doubtful, was not largely relished at the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Innisfail announced his intention of remaining where he had dined;
      but he was one of the few men who could afford to brave Lady Innisfail&rsquo;s
      disdain and to decline to be chilled by her cold glances. The other men
      who did not want to be entertained on the principles formulated by Lady
      Innisfail, meanly kept out of her way after dinner. They hoped that they
      might have a chance of declaring solemnly afterwards, that they had been
      anxious to go, but had waited in vain for information as to the hour of
      departure, the costume to be worn, and the password&mdash;if a password
      were needed&mdash;to admit them to the historic rites of the Cruiskeen.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the women declined to go, on the ground that, so far as she could
      gather, the rite was not evangelical. Her views were evangelical.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men&mdash;he was an Orangeman from Ulster&mdash;boldly refused
      to attend what was so plainly a device planned by the Jesuits for the
      capture of the souls&mdash;he assumed that they had souls&mdash;of the
      Innisfail family and their guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Craven professed so ardently to be looking forward to the
      entertainment, that Mr. Airey, with his accustomed observance of the
      distribution of high lights in demeanour as well as in conversation. felt
      certain that she meant to stay at the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      His accuracy of observation was proved when the party were ready to set
      out for Ballycruiskeen. MIss Craven&rsquo;s maid earned that lady&rsquo;s affectionate
      regards to her hostess; she had been foolish enough to sit in the sun
      during the afternoon with that fascinating novel, and as she feared it
      would, her indiscretion had given her a headache accompanied by dizziness.
      She would thus be unable to go with the general party to the village, but
      if she possibly could, she would follow them in an hour&mdash;perhaps
      less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund Airey smiled the smile of the prophet who lives to see his
      prediction realized&mdash;most of the prophets died violent deaths before
      they could have that gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was undoubtedly an indiscretion,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sitting in the sun?&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reading Paul Bourget,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;Talking of indiscretions, has anyone
      seen&mdash;ah, never mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite possible that the old friend whom you say he wrote about, may
      be a person of primitive habits&mdash;he may be inclined to retire early,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Airey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail gave a little puzzled glance at him&mdash;the puzzled
      expression vanished in a moment, however, before the ingenuousness of his
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fool I am becoming!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I really never thought of
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was because you never turned your attention properly to the mystery
      of the headache,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they set off in the early moonlight for their walk along the cliff
      path that, in the course of a mile or so, trended downward and through the
      Pass of Lamdhu, with its dark pines growing half-way up the slope on one
      side. The lower branches of the trees stretched fantastic arms over the
      heads of the party walking on the road through the Pass. In the moonlight
      these fantastic arms seemed draped. The trees seemed attitudinizing to one
      another in a strange pantomime of their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village of Ballycruiskeen lay just beyond the romantic defile, so that
      occasionally the inhabitants failed to hear the sound of the Atlantic
      hoarsely roaring as it was being strangled in the narrow part of the
      lough. They were therefore sometimes merry with a merriment impossible to
      dwellers nearer the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not appear to their visitors that this was one of their merry
      nights. The natives were commanded by their good priest to be merry for
      &ldquo;the quality,&rdquo; under penalties with which they were well acquainted. But
      merriment under a penalty is no more successful than the smile which is
      manufactured in a photographer&rsquo;s studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Conn made the mistake of insisting on all the members of his flock
      washing their faces. They had washed all the picturesqueness out of them,
      Mr. Airey suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Curragh of Ballycruiskeen was a somewhat wild moorland that became
      demoralized into a bog at one extremity. There was, however, a
      sufficiently settled portion to form a dancing green, and at one side of
      this patch the shocking incongruity of chairs&mdash;of a certain sort&mdash;and
      even a sofa&mdash;it was somewhat less certain&mdash;met the eyes of the
      visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind this, ye divils,&rdquo; the priest was saying in an affectionate way to
      the members of his flock, as the party from the Castle approached. &ldquo;Mind
      this, it&rsquo;s dancing a new roof on the chapel that ye are. Every step ye
      take means a slate, so it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was clearly the peroration of the pastor&rsquo;s speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speech of Mr. Phineas O&rsquo;Flaherty, who was a sort of unceremonious
      master of the ceremonies, had been previously delivered, fortunately when
      the guests were out of hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the entertainment seemed to be a very mournful one. It was too
      like examination day at a village school to convey an idea of spontaneous
      mirth. The &ldquo;quality&rdquo; sat severely on the incongruous chairs&mdash;no one
      was brave enough to try the sofa&mdash;and some of the &ldquo;quality&rdquo; used
      double eye-glasses with handles, for the better inspection of the
      performers. This was chilling to the performers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the efforts of Father Conn and his stage manager, Mr.
      O&rsquo;Flaherty, the members of the cast for the entertainment assumed a
      huddled appearance that did themselves great injustice. They declined to
      group themselves effectively, but suggested to Mr. Durdan&mdash;who was
      not silent on the subject&mdash;one of the illustrations to Foxe&rsquo;s Book of
      Martyrs&mdash;a scene in which about a score of persons about to be
      martyred are shown to be awaiting, with an aspect of cheerful resignation
      that deceived no one, their &ldquo;turn&rdquo; at the hands of the executioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merry Irish jig had a depressing effect at first. The priest was
      well-meaning, but he had not the soul of an artist. When a man has devoted
      all his spare moments for several years to the repression of unseemly
      mirth, he is unwise to undertake, at a moment&rsquo;s notice, the duties of
      stimulating such mirth. Under the priest&rsquo;s eye the jig was robbed of its
      jiguity, so to speak. It was the jig of the dancing class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. O&rsquo;Flaherty threatened to scandalize Father Conn by a few exclamations
      about the display of fetlocks&mdash;the priest had so little experience of
      the &ldquo;quality&rdquo; that he fancied a suggestion of slang would be offensive to
      their ears. He did not know that the hero of the &ldquo;quality&rdquo; in England is
      the costermonger, and that a few years ago the hero was the cowboy. But
      Edmund Airey, perceiving with his accustomed shrewdness, how matters
      stood, managed to draw the priest away from the halfhearted exponents of
      the dance, and so questioned him on the statistics of the parish&mdash;for
      Father Conn was as hospitable with his statistics as he was with his
      whiskey punch upon occasions&mdash;that half an hour had passed before
      they returned together to the scene of the dance, the priest with a
      five-pound note of Mr. Airey&rsquo;s pressed against his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murder alive! what&rsquo;s this at all at all?&rdquo; cried Father Conn, becoming
      aware of the utterance of whoop after whoop by the dancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the jig they&rsquo;re dancin&rsquo; at last, an&rsquo; more power to thim!&rdquo; cried
      Phineas O&rsquo;Flaherty, clapping his hands and giving an encouraging whoop or
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was right. The half dozen couples artistically dishevelled, and rapidly
      losing the baleful recollections of having been recently tidied up to meet
      the &ldquo;quality&rdquo;&mdash;rapidly losing every recollection of the critical gaze
      of the &ldquo;quality&rdquo;&mdash;of the power of speech possessed by the priest&mdash;of
      everything, clerical and lay, except the strains of the fiddle which
      occupied an intermediate position between things lay and clerical, being
      wholly demoniac&mdash;these half dozen couples were dancing the jig with a
      breadth and feeling that suggested the youth of the world and the reign of
      Bacchus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black hair flowing in heavy flakes over shoulders unevenly bare&mdash;shapely
      arms flung over heads in an attitude of supreme self-abandonment&mdash;a
      passionate advance, a fervent retreat, then an exchange of musical cries
      like wild gasps for breath, and ever, ever, ever the demoniac music of the
      fiddle, and ever, ever, ever the flashing and flying from the ground like
      the feet of the winged Hermes&mdash;flashing and flashing with the
      moonlight over all, and the fantastic arms of the hill-side pines
      stretched out like the fringed arms of a grotesque Pierrot&mdash;this was
      the scene to which the priest returned with Edmund Airey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw up his hands and was about to rush upon the half-frenzied
      dancers, when Edmund grasped him by the arm, and pointed mutely to the
      attitude of the &ldquo;quality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail and her friends were no longer sitting frigidly on their
      chairs&mdash;the double eye-glasses were dropped, and those who had held
      them were actually joining in the whoops of the dancers. Her ladyship was
      actually clapping her hands in the style of encouragement adopted by Mr.
      O&rsquo;Flaherty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest stood in the attitude in which he had been arrested by the
      artful Edmund Airey. His eyes and his mouth were open, and his right hand
      was pressed against the five-pound note that he had just received. There
      was a good deal of slate-purchasing potentialities in a five-pound note.
      If her ladyship and her guests were shocked&mdash;as the priest, never
      having heard of the skirt dance and its popularity in the drawing-room&mdash;believed
      they should be, they were not displaying their indignation in a usual way.
      They were almost as excited as the performers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Conn seated himself without a word of protest, in one of the chairs
      vacated by the Castle party. He felt that if her ladyship liked that form
      of entertainment, the chapel roof was safe. The amount of injury that
      would be done to the Foul Fiend by the complete re-roofing of the chapel
      should certainly be sufficient to counteract whatever sin might be
      involved in the wild orgy that was being carried on beneath the light of
      the moon. This was the consolation that the priest had as he heard whoop
      after whoop coming from the dancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six couples remained on the green dancing-space. The fiddler was a
      wizened, deformed man with small gleaming eyes. He stood on a stool and
      kept time with one foot. He increased the time of the dance so gradually
      as to lead the dancers imperceptibly on until, without being aware of it,
      they had reached a frenzied pitch that could not be maintained for many
      minutes. But still the six couples continued wildly dancing, the moonlight
      striking them aslant and sending six black quivering shadows far over the
      ground. Suddenly a man dropped out of the line and lay gasping on the
      grass. Then a girl flung herself with a cry into the arms of a woman who
      was standing among the onlookers. Faster still and faster went the
      grotesquely long arms of the dwarf fiddler&mdash;his shadow cast by the
      moonlight was full of horrible suggestions&mdash;and every now and again a
      falsetto whoop came from him, his teeth suddenly gleaming as his lips
      parted in uttering the cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two couples, who now remained facing one another, changing feet with a
      rapidity that caused them to appear constantly off the ground, were
      encouraged by the shouts and applause of their friends. The air was full
      of cries, in which the spectators from the Castle joined. Faster still the
      demoniac music went, every strident note being clearly heard above the
      shouts. But when one of the two couples staggered wildly and fell with
      outstretched arms upon the grass, the shriek of the fiddle sounded but
      faintly above the cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest could restrain himself no longer. He sprang to his feet and
      kicked the stool from under the fiddler, sending the misshapen man
      sprawling in one direction and his instrument with an unearthly shriek in
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence followed that shriek. It lasted but a few seconds, however. The
      figure of a man&mdash;a stranger&mdash;appeared running across the open
      space between the village and the Curragh, where the dance was being held.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held up his right hand in so significant a way, that the priest&rsquo;s foot
      was arrested in the act of implanting another kick upon the stool, and the
      fiddler sat up on the ground and forgot to look for his instrument through
      surprise at the apparition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dancin&rsquo; at the brink of the grave, ye are,&rdquo; gasped the man, as he
      approached the group that had become suddenly congested in anticipation of
      the priest&rsquo;s wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only Brian the boatman, after all,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;Great
      heavens! I had such a curious thought as he appeared. Oh, that dancing! He
      did not seem to be a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no doubt part of the prehistoric rite,&rdquo; said Mr. Airey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How simply lovely!&rdquo; cried Miss Stafford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, man, tell us what you mean,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s herself,&rdquo; gasped Brian. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s nameless. Her wail is
      heard over all the lough&mdash;I heard it with my ears and hurried here
      for your reverence. Don&rsquo;t we know that she never cries except for a
      death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He means the Banshee,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people, I&rsquo;ve heard, think it unlucky to utter her name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So lovely! Just like savages!&rdquo; said Miss Stafford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say the whole thing is only part of the ceremony of the
      Cruiskeen,&rdquo; said Mr. Durdan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brian O&rsquo;Donal,&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;have you come here to try and terrify
      the country side with your romancin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the sacred Powers, your reverence, I heard the cry of her myself, as I
      came by the bend of the lough. If it&rsquo;s not the truth that I&rsquo;m after
      speaking, may I be the one that she&rsquo;s come for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he play the part splendidly?&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost
      think that he was in earnest. Look how the people are crossing
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Stafford looked at them through her double eye-glasses with the long
      handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;The Cruiskeen is the Oberammergau of
      Connaught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund Airey laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive us all for this night!&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;Sure, didn&rsquo;t I
      think that the good that would come of getting on the chapel roof would
      cover the shame of this night! Go to your cabins, my children. You were
      not to blame. It was me and me only. My Lady&rdquo;&mdash;he turned to the
      Innisfail party&mdash;&ldquo;this entertainment is over. God knows I meant it
      for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t yet heard the harper,&rdquo; cried Lady Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the native bards,&rdquo; said Miss Stafford. &ldquo;I should so much like to hear
      a bard. I might even recite a native poem under his tuition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Stafford saw a great future for native Irish poetry in English
      drawing-rooms. It might be the success of a season.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The entertainment&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that romancer Brian, that&rsquo;s done it all,&rdquo; cried Phineas O&rsquo;Flaherty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Flaherty, if it&rsquo;s not the truth may I&mdash;oh, didn&rsquo;t I hear her
      voice, like the wail of a girl in distress?&rdquo; cried Brian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; said Mr. Airey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t believe anything&mdash;we all know that, sir,&rdquo; said Brian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A girl in distress&mdash;I believe in that, at any rate,&rdquo; said Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; said Miss Stafford, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think that I might recite something
      to these poor people?&rdquo; She turned to Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;Poor people! They
      may never have heard a real recitation&mdash;&lsquo;The Dove Cote,&rsquo; &lsquo;Peter&rsquo;s
      Blue Bell&rsquo;&mdash;something simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a movement among her group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner we get back to the Castle the better it will be for all of
      us,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;Yes, Father Constantine, we distinctly looked
      for a native bard, and we are greatly disappointed. Who ever heard of a
      genuine Cruiskeen without a native bard? Why, the thing&rsquo;s absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Connaught Oberammergau without a native bard! <i>Oh, Padre mio&mdash;Padre
      mio!</i>&rdquo; said Miss Stafford, daintily shaking her double eye-glasses at
      the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you heard what the man said. How would it be possible
      for us to continue this scene while that warning voice is in the air?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you give us a chance of hearing the warning voice, we&rsquo;ll forgive you
      everything, and say that the Cruiskeen is a great success,&rdquo; cried Lady
      Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your ladyship takes the short way to the bend of the lough you may
      still hear her,&rdquo; said Brian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take us there, and if we hear her, I&rsquo;ll give you half a sovereign,&rdquo; cried
      her ladyship, enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If harm comes of it don&rsquo;t blame me,&rdquo; said Brian. &ldquo;Step out this way, my
      lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may still be repaid for our trouble in coming so far,&rdquo; said one of the
      party. &ldquo;If we do actually hear the Banshee, I, for one, will feel more
      than satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Stafford, as she hurried away with the party led by Brian, wondered
      if it might not be possible to find a market for a Banshee&rsquo;s cry in a
      London drawing-room. A new emotion was, she understood, eagerly awaited.
      The serpentine dance and the costermonger&rsquo;s lyre had waned. It was
      extremely unlikely that they should survive another season. If she were to
      be first in the field with the Banshee&rsquo;s cry, introduced with a few dainty
      steps of the jig incidental to a poem with a refrain of &ldquo;Asthore&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;Mavourneen,&rdquo; she might yet make a name for herself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.&mdash;ON THE SHRIEK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N a space of time
      that was very brief, owing to the resolution with which Lady Innisfail
      declined to accept the suggestion of short cuts by Brian, the whole party
      found themselves standing breathless at the beginning of the line of
      cliffs. A mist saturated with moonlight had drifted into the lough from
      the Atlantic. It billowed below their eyes along the surface of the water,
      and crawled along the seared faces of the cliffs, but no cold fingers of
      the many-fingered mist clasped the higher ridges. The sound of the
      crashing of the unseen waves about the bases of the cliffs filled the air,
      but there was no other sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impostor!&rdquo; said Edmund Airy, turning upon Brian. &ldquo;You heard no White Lady
      to-night. You have jeopardized our physical and your spiritual health by
      your falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall get no half sovereign from me,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it me that&rsquo;s accountable for her coming and going?&rdquo; cried Brian, with
      as much indignation as he could afford. Even an Irishman cannot afford the
      luxury of being indignant with people who are in the habit of paying him
      well, and an Irishman is ready to sacrifice much to sentiment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s glad
      we should all be this night not to hear the voice of herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail looked at him. She could afford to be indignant, and she
      meant to express her indignation; but when it came to the point she found
      that it was too profound to be susceptible of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come away,&rdquo; she said, after looking severely at Brian for nearly a
      minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lady Innisfail,&rdquo; said Mr. Durdan, &ldquo;I know that you feel indignant,
      fancying that we have been disappointed. Pray do not let such an idea have
      weight with you for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no,&rdquo; said Miss Stafford, who liked speaking in public quite as
      well as Mr. Durdan. &ldquo;Oh, no, no; you have done your best, dear Lady
      Innisfail. The dance was lovely; and though, of course, we should have
      liked to hear a native bard or two, as well as the Banshee&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet bards and Banshees we know to be beyond human control,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Airey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know that if it rested with you, we should hear the Banshee every
      night,&rdquo; said Mr. Durdan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we all know your kindness of heart, dear Lady Innisfail,&rdquo; resumed
      Miss Stafford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you should hear it, and the bard as well,&rdquo; cried Lady Innisfail.
      &ldquo;But as Mr. Airey says&mdash;and he knows all about bard and Banshees and
      such like things Great heaven! We are not disappointed after all, thank
      heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail&rsquo;s exclamation was uttered after there floated to the cliffs
      where she and her friends were standing, from the rolling white mist that
      lay below, the sound of a long wail. It was repeated, only fainter, when
      she had uttered her thanksgiving, and it was followed by a more robust
      shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it lovely?&rdquo; whispered Lady Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; said Miss Stafford, with a shudder. &ldquo;Let us go away&mdash;oh,
      let us go away at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Stafford liked simulated horrors only. The uncanny in verse was dear
      to her; but when, for the first time, she was brought face to face with
      what would have formed the subject of a thrilling romance with a
      suggestion of the supernatural, she shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail; &ldquo;if we remain quiet we may hear it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear it again,&rdquo; cried Miss Stafford. &ldquo;Look at the man. He
      knows all about it. He is one of the natives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to Brian, who was on his knees on the rock muttering petitions
      for the protection of all the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew, however, that his half sovereign was safe, whatever might happen.
      Miss Stafford&rsquo;s remark was reasonable. Brian should know all about the
      Banshee and its potentialities of mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up, you fool!&rdquo; said Edmund Airey, catching the native by the
      shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know as well as I do that a boat with someone aboard
      is adrift in the mist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know that you don&rsquo;t believe in anything.&rdquo; said Brian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in your unlimited laziness and superstition,&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      very sorry, my dear Lady Innisfail, to interfere with your entertainment,
      but it&rsquo;s perfectly clear to me that someone is in distress at the foot of
      the cliffs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you be so horrid&mdash;so commonplace?&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is one of the modern iconoclasts,&rdquo; said another of the group. &ldquo;He
      would fling down our most cherished beliefs. He told me that he considered
      Madame Blavatsky a swindler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mr. Airey,&rdquo; said Miss Stafford, who was becoming less timid as the
      wail from the sea had not been repeated. &ldquo;Dear Mr. Airey, let us entreat
      of you to leave us our Banshee whatever you may take from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some things in heaven and earth that refuse to be governed by a
      phrase,&rdquo; sneered Mr. Durdan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mules and the members of the Opposition are among them,&rdquo; said Edmund,
      preparing to descend the cliffs by the zig-zag track.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely disappeared in the mist when there was a shriek from Miss
      Stafford, and pointing down the track with a gesture, which for
      expressiveness, she had never surpassed in the most powerful of her
      recitations, she flung herself into Lady Innisfail&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; cried Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;It is the White Lady herself&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all lost, and the half sovereign&rsquo;s nothing here or there,&rdquo; said
      Brian, in a tone of complete resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the mist there seemed to float a white figure of a girl. She stood
      for some moments with the faint mist around her, and while the group on
      the cliff watched her&mdash;some of them found it necessary to cling
      together&mdash;another white figure floated through the mist to the side
      of the first, and then came another figure&mdash;that of a man&mdash;only
      he did not float.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would not cling quite so close to me, my dear; I can&rsquo;t see
      anything of what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail to Miss Stafford, whose
      head was certainly an inconvenience to Lady Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden, determined movement she shifted the head from her bosom to
      her shoulder, and the instant that this feat was accomplished she cried
      out, &ldquo;Helen Craven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen Craven?&rdquo; said Miss Stafford, recovering the use of her head in a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Helen Craven or her ghost that&rsquo;s standing there,&rdquo; said Lady
      Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Harold Wynne is with her. Are you there, Wynne?&rdquo; sang out Mr. Durdan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo?&rdquo; came the voice of Harold from below. &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re all here,&rdquo; cried Edmund, emerging from the mist at his side.
      &ldquo;How on earth did you get here?&mdash;and Miss Craven&mdash;and&mdash;he
      looked at the third figure&mdash;he had never seen the third figure
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; laughed Harold. &ldquo;Will you give a hand to Miss
      Craven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Airey said it would please him greatly to do so, and by his kindly aid
      Miss Craven was, in the course of a few minutes, placed by the side of
      Lady Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the place just vacated by Miss Stafford on Lady Innisfail&rsquo;s
      bosom, and was even more embarrassing to Lady Innisfail than the other had
      been. Helen Craven was heavier, to start with.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was rather by reason of her earnest desire to see the strange face,
      that Lady Innisfail found Helen&rsquo;s head greatly in her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Innisfail, when Miss Craven is quite finished with you, I shall
      present to you Miss Avon,&rdquo; said Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be delighted,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;Dearest Helen, can you not
      spare me for a moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen raised her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that everyone perceived how great was the devastation done by
      the mist to the graceful little curled fringes of her forehead. Her hair
      was lank, showing that she had as massive a brow as Miss Stafford&rsquo;s, if
      she wished to display it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great pleasure to me to meet you, Miss Avon; I&rsquo;m sure that I have
      often heard of you from Mr. Wynne and&mdash;oh, yes, many other people,&rdquo;
       said Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;But just now&mdash;well, you can understand that we
      are all bewildered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we are all bewildered,&rdquo; said Miss Avon. &ldquo;You see, we heard the cry
      of the White Lady&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Harold; &ldquo;we heard it too. The White Lady was Miss
      Craven. She was in one of the boats, and the mist coming on so suddenly,
      she could not find her way back to the landing place. Luckily we were able
      to take her boat in tow before it got knocked to pieces. I hope Miss
      Craven did not over-exert herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;What on earth induced you to go out in
      a boat alone, Helen&mdash;and suffering from so severe a headache into the
      bargain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt confident that the cool air would do me good,&rdquo; said Miss Craven.
      somewhat dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail looked at her in silence for some moments, then she
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one else seemed to perceive any reason for laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail then turned her eyes upon Miss Avon. The result of her
      observation was precisely the same as the result of Harold&rsquo;s first sight
      of that face had been. Lady Innisfail felt that she had never seen so
      beautiful a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Lady Innisfail laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally she looked at Harold and laughed for the third time. The space of
      a minute nearly was occupied by her observations and her laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that on the whole we should hasten on to the Castle,&rdquo; said she at
      length. &ldquo;Miss Craven is pretty certain to be fatigued&mdash;we are, at any
      rate. Of course you will come with us, Miss Avon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The group on the cliff ceased to be a group when she had spoken; but Miss
      Avon did not move with the others. Harold also remained by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I should do,&rdquo; said Miss Avon. &ldquo;The boat is at the foot
      of the cliff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be impossible for you to find your course so long as the mist
      continues,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;Miss Avon and her father&mdash;he is an old
      friend of mine&mdash;we breakfasted together at my college&mdash;are
      living in the White House&mdash;you may have heard its name&mdash;on the
      opposite shore&mdash;only a mile by sea, but six by land,&rdquo; he added,
      turning to Lady Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Returning to-night is out of the question,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;You
      must come with us to the Castle for to-night. I shall explain all to your
      father to-morrow, if any explanation is needed.&rdquo; Miss Avon shook her head,
      and murmured a recognition of Lady Innisfail&rsquo;s kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Brian,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;He will confront your father in the
      morning with the whole story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with the whole story,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail, with an amusing emphasis
      on the words. &ldquo;I already owe Brian half a sovereign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Brian will carry the message all for love,&rdquo; cried the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail did her best to imitate the captivating freshness of the
      girl&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All for love&mdash;all for love!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold smiled. He remembered having had brought under his notice a toy
      nightingale that imitated the song of the nightingale so closely that the
      Jew dealer, who wanted to sell the thing, declared that no one on earth
      could tell the difference between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volubility of Brian in declaring that he would do anything out of love
      for Miss Avon was amazing. He went down the cliff face to bring the boats
      round to the regular moorings, promising to be at the Castle in half an
      hour to receive Miss Avon&rsquo;s letter to be put into her father&rsquo;s hand at his
      hour of rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time Miss Avon and Harold had walked to the Castle with Lady
      Innisfail, they had acquainted her with a few of the incidents of the
      evening&mdash;how they also had been caught by the mist while in their
      boat, and had with considerable trouble succeeded in reaching the craft in
      which Miss Craven was helplessly drifting. They had heard Miss Craven&rsquo;s
      cry for help, they said, and Harold had replied to it. But still they had
      some trouble picking up her boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail heard all the story, and ventured to assert that all was
      well that ended well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is the end,&rdquo; she cried, as she pointed to the shining hall seen
      through the open doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, this is the end of all&mdash;a pleasant end to the story,&rdquo; said the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold followed them as they entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered if this was the end of the story, or only the beginning.

      people that the judge, during his vacation, had solved the problem set by
      the philosopher to his horse. He had learned to live on a straw a day,
      only there was something perpetually at the end of his straw&mdash;something
      with a preposterous American name in a tumbler to match.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the tumbler and the straw on a small table by his side while he
      watched, with great unsteadiness, the strokes of the billiard players.
    </p>
    <p>
      From an hour after dinner he was in a condition of perpetual dozing. This
      was his condition also from an hour after the opening of a case in court,
      which required the closest attention to enable even the most delicately
      appreciative mind to grasp even its simplest elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, he said, been the most widely awake of counsel for thirty years,
      so that he rather thought he was entitled to a few years dozing as a
      judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other people&mdash;they were his admirers&mdash;said that his dozing
      represented an alertness far beyond that of the most conscientiously
      wakeful and watchful of the judicial establishment in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to resemble Homer&mdash;in nodding&mdash;and in this special
      Homeric quality the judge excelled; but it was generally understood that
      it would not be wise to count upon his nodding himself into a condition of
      unobservance. He had already delivered judgment on the character of the
      fine cannons of one of the players in the hall, and upon the hazards of
      the other. He had declined to mark the game, however, and he had thereby
      shown his knowledge of human nature. There had already been four disputes
      as to the accuracy of the marking. (It was being done by a younger man).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can a man expect to make his favourite break after some hours on a
      diabolical Irish jaunting car?&rdquo; one of the players was asking, as he bent
      over the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were uttered at the moment of Harold&rsquo;s entrance, close behind
      Lady Innisfail and Miss Avon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the words he stood motionless before he had taken half-a-dozen
      steps into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail also stopped at the same instant, and looked over her
      shoulder at Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the silence there came the little click of the billiard balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker gave the instinctive twist of the practised billiard player
      toward the pocket that he wished the ball to approach. Then he took a
      breath and straightened himself in a way that would have made any close
      observer aware of the fact that he was no longer a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, more than a suggestion of juvenility in his manner of
      greeting Lady Innisfail. He was as effusive as is consistent with the
      modern spirit of indifference to the claims of hostesses and all other
      persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not so effusive when he turned to Harold; but that was only to be
      expected, because Harold was his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my boy,&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t fancy that you would expect
      to see me here to-night&mdash;I feel surprised to find myself here. It
      seems like a dream to me&mdash;a charming dream-vista with Lady Innisfail
      at the end of the vista. Innisfail always ruins his chances of winning a
      game by attempting a screw back into the pocket. He leaves everything on.
      You&rsquo;ll see what my game is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He chalked his cue and bent over the table once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold watched him make the stroke. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see what my game is,&rdquo; said
      Lord Fotheringay, as he settled himself down to a long break.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold questioned it greatly. His father&rsquo;s games were rarely transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth can have brought him?&mdash;oh, he takes one&rsquo;s breath
      away,&rdquo; whispered Lady Innisfail to Harold, with a pretty fair imitation of
      a smile lingering about some parts of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold shook his head. There was not even the imitation of a smile about
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail gave a laugh, and turned quickly to Miss Avon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband will be delighted to meet you, my dear,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He is
      certain to know your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harold watched Lord Innisfail shaking hands with Miss Avon at the side of
      the billiard table, while his father bent down to make another stroke.
      When the stroke was played he saw his father straighten himself and look
      toward Miss Avon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look was a long one and an interested one. Then the girl disappeared
      with Lady Innisfail, and the look that Lord Fotheringay cast at his son
      was a short one, but it was quite as intelligible to that soft as the long
      look at Miss Avon had been to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold went slowly and in a singularly contemplative mood to his bedroom,
      whence he emerged in a space, wearing a smoking-jacket and carrying a pipe
      and tobacco pouch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smoking-jackets that glowed through the hall towards the last hour of
      the day at Castle Innisfail were a dream of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail had given orders to have a variety of sandwiches and other
      delicacies brought to the hall for those of her guests who had attended
      the festivities at Ballycruiskeen; and when Harold found his way
      downstairs, he perceived in a moment that only a few of the feeble ones of
      the house-party&mdash;the fishermen who had touches of rheumatism and the
      young women who cherished their complexions&mdash;were absent from the
      hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also noticed that his father was seated by the side of Beatrice Avon
      and that he was succeeding in making himself interesting to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that his father generally succeeded in making himself interesting
      to women.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another part of the hall Lady Innisfail was succeeding in making
      herself interesting to some of the men. She also was accustomed to meet
      with success in this direction. She was describing to such as had
      contrived to escape the walk to Ballycruiskeen, the inexhaustibly romantic
      charm of the scene on the Curragh while the natives were dancing, and the
      descriptions certainly were not deficient in colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men listened to her with such an aspect of being enthralled, she felt
      certain that they were full of regret that they had failed to witness the
      dance. It so happened, however, that the result of her account of the
      scene was to lead those of her audience who had remained at the Castle, to
      congratulate themselves upon a lucky escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this time, Harold noticed that his father was making himself
      interesting to Beatrice Avon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way for any man to make himself interesting to a woman is to show
      himself interested in her. He knew that his father was well aware of this
      fact, and that he was getting Beatrice Avon to tell him all about herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Lady Innisfail reached the final situation in her dramatic
      account of the dance, and hurried her listeners to the brink of the cliff&mdash;when
      she reproduced in a soprano that was still vibratory, the cry that had
      sounded through the mist&mdash;when she pointed to Miss Avon in telling of
      the white figure that had emerged from the mist&mdash;(Lady Innisfail did
      not think it necessary to allude to Helen Craven, who had gone to bed)&mdash;the
      auditors&rsquo; interest was real and not simulated. They looked at the white
      figure as Lady Innisfail pointed to her, and their interest was genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could at least appreciate this element of the evening&rsquo;s
      entertainment, and as they glanced at Harold, who was eating a number of
      sandwiches in a self-satisfied way, they thought that they might safely
      assume that he was the luckiest of the <i>dramatis personae</i> of the
      comedy&mdash;or was it a tragedy?&mdash;described by Lady Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this time Harold was noticing that his father, by increasing his
      interest in Beatrice, was making himself additionally interesting to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the judge had also&mdash;at the intervals between his Homeric nods&mdash;been
      noticing the living things around him. He put aside his glass and its
      straw&mdash;he had been toying with it all the evening, though the liquid
      that mounted by capillary attraction up the tube was something noisome,
      without a trace of alcohol&mdash;and seated himself on the other side of
      the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      He assured her that he had known her father. Lord Fotheringay did not
      believe him; but this was not to the point, and he knew it. What was to
      the point was the fact that the judge understood the elements of the art
      of interesting a girl almost as fully as Lord Fotheringay did, without
      having quite made it the serious business of his life. The result was that
      Miss Avon was soon telling the judge all about herself&mdash;this was what
      the judge professed to be the most anxious to hear&mdash;and Lord
      Fotheringay lit a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt somewhat bitterly on the subject of the judge&rsquo;s intrusion. But the
      feeling did not last for long. He reflected upon the circumstance that
      Miss Avon could never have heard that he himself was a very wicked man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that the interest that attaches to a man with a reputation for
      being very wicked is such as need fear no rival. He felt that should his
      power to interest a young woman ever be jeopardized, he could still fall
      back upon his bad character and be certain to attract her.

      CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;ON PROVIDENCE AS A MATCH-MAKER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>F course,&rdquo; said
      Lady Innisfail to Edmund Airey the next day. &ldquo;Of course, if Harold alone
      had rescued Helen from her danger last night, all would have been well.
      You know as well as I do that when a man rescues a young woman from a
      position of great danger, he can scarcely do less than ask her to marry
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Edmund. &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t see how, if he has any
      dramatic appreciation whatever, he could avoid asking her to marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is beyond a question,&rdquo; said Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;So that if Harold had
      been alone in the boat all would have been well. The fact of Miss Avon&rsquo;s
      being also in the boat must, however, be faced. It complicates matters
      exceedingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund shook his head gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that you would see the force of it,&rdquo; resumed Lady Innisfail. &ldquo;And
      then there is his father&mdash;his father must be taken into account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be as well, though I know that Lord Fotheringay&rsquo;s views are the
      same as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure that they are; but why, then, does he come here to sit by the
      side of the other girl and interest her as he did last evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Fotheringay can never be otherwise than interesting, even to people
      who do not know how entirely devoid of scruple he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know all that; but why should he come here and sit beside so
      very pretty a girl as this Miss Avon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no accounting for tastes, Lady Innisfail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very stupid, Mr. Airey. What I mean is, why should Lord
      Fotheringay behave in such a way as must force his son&rsquo;s attention to be
      turned in a direction that&mdash;that&mdash;in short, it should not be
      turned in? Heaven knows that I want to do the best for Harold&mdash;I like
      him so well that I could almost wish him to remain unmarried. But you know
      as well as I do, that it is absolutely necessary for him to marry a girl
      with a considerable amount of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as certain as anything can be. I gave him the best advice in my
      power on this subject, and he announced his intention of asking Miss
      Craven to marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But instead of asking her he strolled round the coast to that wretched
      cave, and there met, by accident, the other girl&mdash;oh, these other
      girls are always appearing on the scene at the wrong moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world would go on beautifully if it were not for the Other Girl.&rdquo;
       said Edmund. &ldquo;If you think of it, there is not an event in history that
      has not turned upon the opportune or inopportune appearance of the Other
      Girl. Nothing worth speaking of has taken place, unless by the agency of
      the Other Girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet Lord Fotheringay comes here and sits by the side of this charming
      girl, and his son watches him making himself interesting to her as, alas!
      he can do but too easily. Mr. Airey, I should not be surprised if Harold
      were to ask Miss Avon to-day to marry him&mdash;I should not, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think you take too pessimistic a view of the matter altogether,
      Lady Innisfail. Anyhow, I don&rsquo;t see that we can do more than we have
      already done. I think I should feel greatly inclined to let Providence and
      Lord Fotheringay fight out the matter between them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the archangel and the Other over the body of Moses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, something like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Airey; I don&rsquo;t believe in Providence as a match-maker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Airey gave a laugh. He wondered if it was possible that Harold had
      mentioned to her that he, Edmund, had expressed the belief that Providence
      as a match-maker had much to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we can interfere,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I like Harold Wynne greatly.
      He means to do something in the world, and I believe he will do it. He
      affords a convincing example of the collapse of heredity as a principle. I
      like him if only for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Innisfail looked at him in silence for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;Harold does seem to differ greatly from his
      father. I wonder if it is the decree of Providence that has kept him
      without money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suggest that the absence of money&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I suggest nothing. If a man must be wicked he&rsquo;ll be wicked
      without money almost as readily as with it. Only I wonder, if Harold had
      come in for the title and the property&mdash;such as it was&mdash;at the
      same age as his father was when he inherited all, would he be so ready as
      you say he is to do useful work on the side of the government of his
      country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a question for the philosophers,&rdquo; said Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this unsatisfactory way the conversation between Lady Innisfail and Mr.
      Airey on the morning after Lord Fotheringay&rsquo;s arrival at the Castle, came
      to an end. No conversation that ends in referring the question under
      consideration to the philosophers, can by any possibility be thought
      satisfactory. But the conversation could not well be continued when Miss
      Craven, by the side of Miss Avon, was seen to be approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund Airey turned his eyes upon the two girls, then they rested upon the
      face of Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she came closer his glance rested upon the eyes of Beatrice. The result
      of his observation was to convince him that he had never before seen such
      beautiful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were certainly gray; and they were as full of expression as gray eyes
      can be. They were large, and to look into them seemed like looking into
      the transparent depths of an unfathomed sea&mdash;into the transparent
      heights of an inexhaustible heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      A glimpse of heaven suggests the bliss of the beatified. A glimpse of the
      ocean suggests shipwreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew this perfectly well as he looked at her eyes; but only for an
      instant did it occur to him that they conveyed some message to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had time to think whether the message promised the bliss of the
      dwellers in the highest heaven, or the disaster of those who go down into
      the depths of the deepest sea, he was inquiring from Helen Craven if the
      chill of which she had complained on the previous night, had developed
      into a cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Craven assured him that, so far from experiencing any ill effects
      from her adventure, she had never felt better in all her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But had it not been for Miss Avon&rsquo;s hearing my cries of despair, goodness
      knows where I should have been in another ten minutes,&rdquo; she added, putting
      her arm round Miss Avon&rsquo;s waist, and looking, as Edmund had done, into the
      mysterious depths of Miss Avon&rsquo;s gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Miss Avon. &ldquo;To tell you the plain truth, I did not hear
      your cries. It was Mr. Wynne who said he heard the White Lady wailing for
      her lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could he translate the cry so accurately?&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;Do you
      suppose that he had heard the Banshee&rsquo;s cry at the same place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kept his eyes upon Miss Avon&rsquo;s face, and he saw in a moment that she
      was wondering how much he knew of the movements of Harold Wynne during the
      previous two nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen Craven looked at him also pretty narrowly. She was wondering if he
      had told anyone that he had suggested to her the possibility of Harold&rsquo;s
      being in the neighbourhood of the Banshee&rsquo;s Cave during the previous
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both girls laughed in another moment, and then Edmund Airey laughed also&mdash;in
      a sort of way. Lady Innisfail was the last to join in the laugh. But what
      she laughed at was the way in which Edmund had laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while this group of four were upon the northern terrace, Harold was
      seated the side of his father on one of the chairs that faced the south.
      Lord Fotheringay was partial to a southern aspect. His life might be said
      to be a life of southern aspects. He meant that it should never be out of
      the sun, not because some of the incidents that seemed to him to make life
      worth preserving were such as could best stand the searching light of the
      sun, but simply because his was the nature of the butterfly. He was a
      butterfly of fifty-seven&mdash;a butterfly that found it necessary to
      touch up with artificial powders the ravages of years upon the delicate,
      downy bloom of youth&mdash;a butterfly whose wings had now and again been
      singed by contact with a harmful flame&mdash;whose still shapely body was
      now and again bent with rheumatism. Surely the rheumatic butterfly is the
      most wretched of insects!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had fluttered away from a fresh singeing, he was assuring his son. Yes,
      he had scarcely strength left in his wings to carry him out of the sphere
      of influence of the flame. He had, he said in a mournful tone, been very
      badly treated. She had treated him very badly. The Italian nature was
      essentially false&mdash;he might have known it&mdash;and when an Italian
      nature is developed with a high soprano, very shrill in its upper
      register, the result was&mdash;well, the result was that the flame had
      singed the wings of the elderly insect who was Harold&rsquo;s father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk of money!&rdquo; he cried, with so sudden an expression of emotion that a
      few caked scraps of sickly, roseate powder fluttered from the crinkled
      lines of his forehead&mdash;Talk of money! It was not a matter of hundreds&mdash;he
      was quite prepared for that&mdash;but when the bill ran up to thousands&mdash;thousands&mdash;thousands&mdash;oh,
      the whole affair was sickening. (Harold cordially agreed with him, though
      he did not express himself to this effect). Was it not enough to shake
      one&rsquo;s confidence in woman&mdash;in human nature&mdash;in human art
      (operatic)&mdash;in the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was the Husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Husband, Lord Fotheringay was disposed to regard in pretty much the
      same light as Mr. Airey regarded the Other Girl. The Husband was not
      exactly the obstacle, but the inconvenience. He had a habit of turning up,
      and it appeared that in the latest of Lord Fotheringay&rsquo;s experiences his
      turning up had been more than usually inopportune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I followed so close upon the heels of my letter to you,&rdquo; said
      the father. &ldquo;The crash came in a moment&mdash;it was literally a crash
      too, now that I think upon it, for that hot-blooded ruffian, her husband,
      caught one corner of the table cloth&mdash;we were at supper&mdash;and
      swept everything that was on the table into a corner of the room. Yes, the
      bill is in my portmanteau. And she took his part. Heavens above! She
      actually took his part. I was the scoundrel&mdash;<i>briccone!</i>&mdash;the
      coarse Italian is still ringing in my ears. It was anything but a charming
      duetto. He sang a basso&mdash;her upper register was terribly shrill&mdash;I
      had never heard it more so. Artistically the scene was a failure; but I
      had to run for all that. Humiliating, is it not, to be overcome by
      something that would, if subjected to the recognized canons of criticism,
      be pronounced a failure? And he swore that he would follow me and have my
      life. Enough. You got my letter. Fortune is on your side, my boy. You
      saved her life last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose life did I save?&rdquo; asked the son. &ldquo;Whose life? Heavens above! Have
      you been saving more than one life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more than one&mdash;a good deal less than one. Don&rsquo;t let us get into
      a sentimental strain, pater. You are the chartered&mdash;ah, the chartered
      sentimentalist of the family. Don&rsquo;t try and drag me into your strain. I&rsquo;m
      not old enough. A man cannot pose as a sentimentalist nowadays until he is
      approaching sixty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Then I shall have to pause for a year or two still. Let us put
      that question aside for a moment. Should I be exceeding my privileges if I
      were to tell you that I am ruined?&mdash;Financially ruined, I mean, of
      course; thank heaven, I am physically as strong as I was&mdash;ah, three
      years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said something about my allowance, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did not I failed in my duty as a father, and I don&rsquo;t often do that,
      my boy&mdash;thank God, I don&rsquo;t often do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;If the whole duty of a father is comprised in
      acquainting his son with the various reductions that he says he finds it
      necessary to make in his allowance, you are the most exemplary of fathers,
      pater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a suspicion of sarcasm&mdash;or what is worse, epigram in that
      phrase,&rdquo; said the father. &ldquo;Never mind, you cannot epigram away the stern
      fact that I have now barely a sufficient income to keep body and soul
      together. I wish you could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;But yours is a <i>ménage à trois</i>. It is not
      merely body and soul with your but body, soul, and sentiment&mdash;it is
      the third element that is the expensive one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you are right. Anyhow, I grieve for your position, my boy. If
      it had pleased Heaven to make me a rich man, I would see that your
      allowance was a handsome one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But since it has pleased the other Power to make you a poor one&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must marry Miss Craven&mdash;that&rsquo;s the end of the whole matter, and
      an end that most people would be disposed to regard as a very happy one,
      too. She is a virtuous young woman, and what is better, she dresses
      extremely well. What is best of all, she has several thousands a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a suggestion of the eighteenth century phraseology in Lord
      Fotheringay&rsquo;s speech, that made him seem at least a hundred years old.
      Surely people did not turn up their eyes and talk of virtue since the
      eighteenth century, Harold thought. The word had gone out. There was no
      more need for it. The quality is taken for granted in the nineteenth
      century.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a trifle over-vehement,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I ever refused to ask Miss Craven to marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever asked her&mdash;that&rsquo;s the matter before us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. But what does that mean? Why, simply that I have before me instead
      of behind me a most interesting quarter of an hour&mdash;I suppose a
      penniless man can ask a wealthy woman inside a quarter of an hour, to
      marry him. The proposition doesn&rsquo;t take longer in such a case than an
      honourable one would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are speaking in a way that is not becoming in a son addressing his
      father,&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay. &ldquo;You almost make me ashamed of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had no reason to be ashamed of me yet,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;So long as
      I refrain from doing what you command me to do, I give you no cause to be
      ashamed of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a pretty thing for a son to say,&rdquo; cried the father, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t let us begin a family broil under the windows of
      a house where we are guests,&rdquo; said the son, rising quickly from the chair.
      &ldquo;We are on the border of a genuine family bickering. For God&rsquo;s sake let us
      stop in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not come here to bicker,&rdquo; said the father. &ldquo;Heavens above! Am I not
      entitled to some show of gratitude at least for having come more than a
      thousand miles&mdash;a hundred of them in an Irish train and ten of them
      on an Irish jolting car&mdash;simply to see that you are comfortably
      settled for life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the son, &ldquo;I suppose I should feel grateful to you for coming
      so far to tell me that you are ruined and that I am a partner in your
      ruin.&rdquo; He had not seated himself, and now he turned his back upon his
      father and walked round to the west side of the Castle where some of the
      girls were strolling. They were waiting to see how the day would develop&mdash;if
      they should put on oilskins and sou&rsquo;westers or gauzes and gossamer&mdash;the
      weather on the confines of the ocean knows only the extremes of winter or
      summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The furthest of the watchers were, he perceived, Edmund Airey and Miss
      Avon. He walked toward them, and pronounced in a somewhat irresponsible
      way an opinion upon the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the topic had been adequately discussed, Mr. Durdan and another man
      came up to remind Mr. Airey that he had given them his word to be of their
      party in the fishing boat, where they were accustomed to study the Irish
      question for some hours daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Airey protested that his promise had been wholly a conditional one. It
      had not been made on the assumption that the lough should be moaning like
      a Wagnerian trombone, and it could not be denied that such notes were
      being produced by the great rollers beneath the influence of a westerly
      wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold gave a little shrug to suggest to Beatrice that the matter was not
      one that concerned her or himself in the least, and that it might be as
      well if Mr. Airey and his friends were left to discuss it by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shrug scarcely suggested all that he meant it to suggest, but in the
      course of a minute he was by the side of the girl a dozen yards away from
      the three men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you chanced to tell Mr. Airey of the queer way you and I
      met,&rdquo; she said in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I have told any human being of that incident?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why
      do you ask me such a question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows all about it&mdash;so much is certain,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Oh, yes, he
      gave me to understand so much&mdash;not with brutal directness, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I should say not&mdash;brutal directness is not in his line,&rdquo; said
      Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the result is just the same as if he had been as direct as&mdash;as a
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He said something about Miss Craven&rsquo;s voice having suggested
      something supernatural to Brian, and then he asked me all at once if there
      had been any mist on the previous evening when I had rowed across the
      lough. Now I should like to know how he guessed that I had crossed the
      lough on the previous night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is clever&mdash;diabolically clever,&rdquo; said Harold after a pause. &ldquo;He
      was with Miss Craven in the hall&mdash;they had been dancing&mdash;when I
      returned&mdash;I noticed the way he looked at me. Was there anything in my
      face to tell him that&mdash;that I had met you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at his face and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your face,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Your face&mdash;what could there have been
      apparent on your face for Mr. Airey to read?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what?&rdquo; his voice was low. He was now looking into her gray
      eyes. &ldquo;What was there upon my face? I cannot tell. Was it a sense of doom?
      God knows. Now that I look upon your face&mdash;even now I cannot tell
      whether I feel the peace of God which passes understanding, or the doom of
      those who go down to the sea and are lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like to hear you speak in that way,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It would be
      better for me to die than to mean anything except what is peaceful and
      comforting to all of God&rsquo;s creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be better for you to die,&rdquo; said he. He took his eyes away from
      hers. They stood side by side in silence for some moments, before he
      turned suddenly to her and said in quite a different strain. &ldquo;I shall row
      you across the lough when you are ready. Will you go after lunch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I shall be going quite so soon,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The fact
      is that Lady Innisfail was good enough to send Brian with another letter
      to my father&mdash;a letter from herself, asking my father to come to the
      Castle for a day or two, but, whether he comes or not, to allow me to
      remain for some days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again some moments passed before Harold spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to promise to let me know where you go when you leave
      Ireland,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lose sight of you. The world is large.
      I wandered about in it for nearly thirty years before meeting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent. It seemed as if she was considering whether or not his
      last sentence should be regarded as a positive proof of the magnitude of
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared to come to the conclusion that it would be unwise to discuss
      the question&mdash;after all, it was only a question of statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish it,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I shall let you know our next halting-place.
      I fancy that my poor father is less enthusiastic than he was some years
      ago on the subject of Irish patriotism. At any rate, I think that he has
      worked out all the battles fought in this region.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only let me know where you go,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I do not want to lose sight of
      you. What did you say just now&mdash;peace and comfort to God&rsquo;s creatures?
      No, I do not want to lose sight of you.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;ON THE PROFESSIONAL MORALIST.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE people&mdash;Edmund
      Airey was one of them&mdash;who were accustomed to point to Harold Wynne
      as an example of the insecurity of formulating any definite theory of
      heredity, had no chance of being made aware of the nature of the
      conversations in which he had taken part, or they might not have been
      quite so ready to question the truth of that theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father had made it plain to him, both by letter and word of mouth,
      that the proper course for him to pursue was one that involved asking
      Helen Craven to marry him&mdash;the adoption of any other course, even a
      prosaic one, would practically mean ruin to him; and yet he had gone
      straight from the side of his father, not to the side of Miss Craven, but
      to the side of Miss Avon. And not only had he done this, but he had looked
      into the gray eyes of Beatrice when he should have been gazing with ardour&mdash;or
      simulated ardour&mdash;into the rather lustreless orbs of Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do precisely the thing which he ought not to have done was certainly a
      trait which he had inherited from his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had not merely looked into the eyes of the one girl when he should
      have been looking into those of the other girl, he had spoken into her
      ears such words as would, if spoken into the ears of the other girl, have
      made her happy. The chances were that the words which he had spoken would
      lead to unhappiness. To speak such words had been his father&rsquo;s weakness
      all his life, so that it seemed that Harold had inherited this weakness
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps for a moment or two, after Edmund Airey had sauntered up, having
      got the better of the argument with Mr. Durdan&mdash;he flattered himself
      that he had invariably got the better of him in the House of Commons&mdash;Harold
      felt that he was as rebellious against the excellent counsels of his
      father as his father had ever been against the excellent precepts which
      society has laid down for its own protection. He knew that the
      circumstance of his father&rsquo;s having never accepted the good advice which
      had been offered to him as freely as advice, good and bad, is usually
      offered to people who are almost certain not to follow it, did not
      diminish from the wisdom of the course which his father had urged upon him
      to pursue. He had acknowledged to Edmund Airey some days before, that the
      substance of the advice was good, and had expressed his intention of
      following it&mdash;nay, he felt even when he had walked straight from his
      father&rsquo;s side to indulge in that earnest look into the eyes of Beatrice,
      that it was almost inevitable that he should take the advice of his
      father; for however distasteful it may be, the advice of a father is
      sometimes acted on by a son. But still the act of rebellion had been
      pleasant to him&mdash;as pleasant to him as his father&rsquo;s acts of the same
      character had been to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this time Helen Craven was making her usual elaborate preparations
      for finishing her sketch of some local scene, and everyone knew that she
      could not seek that scene unless accompanied by someone to carry her
      umbrella and stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay perceived this in a moment from his seat facing the
      south. He saw that Providence was on the side of art, so to speak&mdash;assuming
      that a water-colour sketch of a natural landscape by an amateur is art,
      and assuming that Providence meant simply an opportunity for his son to
      ask Miss Craven to marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay saw how Miss Craven lingered with her colour-box in one
      hand and her stool in the other. What was she waiting for? He did not
      venture to think that she was waiting for Harold to saunter up and take
      possession of her apparatus, but he felt certain that if Harold were to
      saunter up, Miss Craven&rsquo;s eyes would brighten&mdash;so far as such eyes as
      hers could brighten. His teeth met with a snap that threatened the gold
      springs when he saw some other man stroll up and express the hope that
      Miss Craven would permit him to carry her stool and umbrella, for her
      sketching umbrella was brought from the hall by a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay&rsquo;s indignation against his son was great afterwards. He
      made an excellent attempt to express to Edmund Airey what he felt on the
      subject of Harold&rsquo;s conduct, and Edmund shook his head most
      sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to be done, Lord Fotheringay inquired. What was to be done in
      order to make Harold act in accordance with the dictates not merely of
      prudence but of necessity as well?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Airey could not see that any positive action could be taken in order
      to compel Harold to adopt the course which every sensible person would
      admit was the right course&mdash;in fact the only course open to him under
      the circumstances. He added that only two days ago Harold had admitted
      that he meant to ask Miss Craven to marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens above!&rdquo; cried Lord Fotheringay. &ldquo;He never admitted so much to me.
      Then what has occurred to change him within a few days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In such a case as this it is as well not to ask <i>what</i> but <i>who</i>,&rdquo;
       remarked Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay looked at him eagerly. &ldquo;Who&mdash;who&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
      mean another girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I not mean another girl?&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;You may have some
      elementary acquaintance with woman, Lord Fotheringay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have&mdash;yes, elementary,&rdquo; admitted Lord Fotheringay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then surely you must have perceived that a man&rsquo;s attention is turned away
      from one woman only by the appearance of another woman,&rdquo; said Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that&mdash;by heavens, that notion occurred to me the moment
      that I saw her. She is a lovely creature, Airey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A gray eye or so!&rsquo; said Airey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gray eye or so!&rdquo; cried Lord Fotheringay, who had not given sufficient
      attention to the works of Shakespeare to recognize a quotation. &ldquo;A gray&mdash;Oh,
      you were always a cold-blooded fellow. Such eyes, Airey, are so uncommon
      as&mdash;ah, the eyes are not to the point. They only lend colour to your
      belief that she is the other girl. Yes, that notion occurred to me the
      moment she entered the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that but for her inopportune appearance Harold would now be
      engaged to Miss Craven,&rdquo; said Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not the shadow of a doubt about the matter,&rdquo; cried Lord
      Fotheringay&mdash;both men seemed to regard Miss Craven&rsquo;s acquiescence in
      the scheme which they had in their minds, as outside the discussion
      altogether. &ldquo;Now what on earth did Lady Innisfail mean by asking a girl
      with such eyes to stay here? A girl with such eyes has no business
      appearing among people like us who have to settle our mundane affairs to
      the best advantage. Those eyes are a disturbing influence, Airey. They
      should never be seen while matters are in an unsettled condition. And Lady
      Innisfail professes to be Harold&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so she is,&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;But the delight that Lady Innisfail finds
      in capturing a strange face&mdash;especially when that face is beautiful&mdash;overcomes
      all other considerations with her. That is why, although anxious&mdash;she
      was anxious yesterday, though that is not saying she is anxious today&mdash;to
      hear of Harold&rsquo;s proposing to Miss Craven, yet she is much more anxious to
      see the effect produced by the appearance of Miss Avon among her guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is a Christian country!&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay solemnly, after a
      pause of considerable duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nominally,&rdquo; said Mr. Airey,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is society coming to, Airey, when a woman occupying the position of
      Lady Innisfail, does not hesitate to throw all considerations of
      friendship to the winds solely for the sake of a momentary sensation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay was now so solemn that his words and his method of
      delivering them suggested the earnestness of an evangelist&mdash;zeal is
      always expected from an evangelist, though unbecoming in an ordained
      clergyman. He held one finger out and raised it and lowered it with the
      inflections of his voice with the skill of a professional moralist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely spoken before Miss Avon, by the side of the judge and Miss
      Innisfail, appeared on the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge&mdash;he said he had known her father&mdash;was beaming on her.
      Professing to know her father he probably considered sufficient
      justification for beaming on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Fotheringay and his companion watched the girl in silence until she
      and her companions had descended to the path leading to the cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Airey,&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay at length. &ldquo;Airey, that boy of mine must be
      prevented from making a fool of himself&mdash;he must be prevented from
      making a fool of that girl. I would not like to see such a girl as that&mdash;I
      think you said you noticed her eyes&mdash;made a fool of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be very sad,&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;But what means do you propose to
      adopt to prevent the increase by two of the many fools already in the
      world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to marry the girl myself,&rdquo; cried Lord Fotheringay, rising to his
      feet&mdash;not without some little difficulty, for rheumatism had for
      years been his greatest enemy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;ON MODERN SOCIETY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>DMUND AIREY had
      the most perfect command of his features under all circumstances. While
      the members of the Front Opposition Benches were endeavouring to sneer him
      into their lobby, upon the occasion of a division on some question on
      which it was rumoured he differed from the Government, he never moved a
      muscle. The flaunts and gibes may have stung him, but he had never yet
      given an indication of feeling the sting; so that if Lord Fotheringay
      looked for any of those twitches about the corners of Mr. Airey&rsquo;s mouth,
      which the sudden announcement of his determination would possibly have
      brought around the mouth of an ordinary man, he must have had little
      experience of his companion&rsquo;s powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that Lord Fotheringay felt on the whole greatly flattered by the
      impassiveness of Edmund Airey&rsquo;s face after his announcement, Edmund Airey
      did not for a moment doubt. When a man of fifty-seven gravely announces
      his intention to another man of marrying a girl of, perhaps, twenty, and
      with eyes of remarkable lustre, and when the man takes such an
      announcement as the merest matter of course, the man who makes it has some
      reason for feeling flattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chances are, however, that he succeeds in proving to his own
      satisfaction that he has no reason for feeling flattered; for the man of
      fifty-seven who is fool enough to entertain the notion of marrying a girl
      of twenty with lustrous eyes, is certainly fool enough to believe that the
      announcement of his intention in this respect is in no way out of the
      common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, when, after a glance concentrated upon the corners of Edmund Airey&rsquo;s
      mouth, Lord Fotheringay resumed his seat and began to give serious reasons
      for taking the step that he had declared himself ready to take&mdash;reasons
      beyond the mere natural desire to prevent Miss Avon from being made a fool
      of&mdash;he gave no indication of feeling in the least flattered by the
      impassiveness of the face of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he explained to Mr. Airey, he had been so badly treated by the world
      that he had almost made up his mind to retire from the world&mdash;the
      exact words in which he expressed that resolution were &ldquo;to let the world
      go to the devil in its own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, as the belief was general that Lord Fotheringay&rsquo;s presence in the
      world had materially accelerated its speed in the direction which he had
      indicated, the announcement of his intention to allow it to proceed
      without his assistance was not absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he had been badly treated by the world, he said. The world was very
      wicked. He felt sad when he thought of the vast amount of wickedness there
      was in the world, and the small amount of it that he had already enjoyed.
      To be sure, it could not be said that he had quite lived the life of the
      ideal anchorite: he admitted&mdash;and smacked his lips as he did so&mdash;that
      he had now and again had a good time (Mr. Airey did not assume that the
      word &ldquo;good&rdquo; was to be accepted in its Sunday-school sense) but on the
      whole the result was disappointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As saith the Preacher,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Airey, when Lord Fotheringay paused
      and shook his head so that another little scrap of caked powder escaped
      from the depths of one of the wrinkles of his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Preacher&mdash;what Preacher?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Preacher who cried <i>Vanitas Vanitatum</i>,&rdquo; said Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had gone on a tour with an Italian opera company,&rdquo; said Lord
      Fotheringay, &ldquo;and he had fallen foul of the basso. Airey, my boy, whatever
      you do, steer clear of a prima donna with a high soprano. It means
      thousands&mdash;thousands, and a precipitate flight at the last. You
      needn&rsquo;t try a gift of paste&mdash;the finest productions of the Ormuz Gem
      Company&mdash;&lsquo;a Tiara for Thirty Shillings&rsquo;&mdash;you know their
      advertisement&mdash;no, I&rsquo;ve tried that. It was no use. The real thing she
      would have&mdash;Heavens above! Two thousand pounds for a trinket, and
      nothing to show for it, but a smashing of supper plates and a hurried
      flight. Ah, Airey, is it any wonder that I should make up my mind to live
      a quiet life with&mdash;I quite forget who was in my mind when I commenced
      this interesting conversation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes no difference,&rdquo; said Mr. Airey. &ldquo;The principle is precisely the
      same. There is Miss Innisfail looking for someone, I must go to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A desperately proper girl,&rdquo; said Lord Fotheringay. &ldquo;As desperately proper
      as if she had once been desperately naughty. These proper girls know a
      vast deal. She scarcely speaks to me. Yes, she must know a lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His remarks were lost upon Mr. Airey, for he had politely hurried to Miss
      Innisfail and was asking her if he could be of any assistance to her. But
      when Miss Innisfail replied that she was merely waiting for Brian, the
      boatman, who should have returned long ago from the other side of the
      lough, Mr. Airey did not return to Lord Fotheringay.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had enough of Lord Fotheringay for one afternoon, and he hoped that
      Lord Fotheringay would understand so much. He had long ago ceased to be
      amusing. As an addition to the house-party at the Castle he was
      unprofitable. He knew that Lady Innisfail was of this opinion, and he was
      well aware also that Lady Innisfail had not given him more than a general
      and very vague invitation to the Castle. He had simply come to the Castle
      in order to avoid the possibly disagreeable consequences of buying some
      thousands of pounds&rsquo; worth of diamonds&mdash;perhaps it would be more
      correct to say, diamonds costing some thousands of pounds, leaving worth
      out of the question&mdash;for a woman with a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Airey knew that the philosophy of Lord Fotheringay was the philosophy of
      the maker of omelettes. No one has yet solved the problem of how to make
      omelettes without breaking eggs. Lord Fotheringay had broken a good many
      eggs in his day, and occasionally the result was that his share of the
      transaction was not the omelette but the broken shells. Occasionally, too,
      Edmund Airey was well aware, Lord Fotheringay had suffered more
      inconvenience than was involved in the mere fact of his being deprived of
      the comestible. His latest adventure. Airey thought, might be included
      among such experiences. He had fled to the brink of the ocean in order to
      avoid the vengeance of the Husband. &ldquo;Here the pursuer can pursue no more,&rdquo;
       was the line that was in Edmund Airey&rsquo;s mind as he listened to the
      fragmentary account of the latest <i>contretemps</i> of the rheumatic
      butterfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he had had quite enough of Lord Fotheringay&rsquo;s company. The
      announcement of his intention to marry Miss Avon had not made him more
      interesting in the eyes of Edmund Airey, though it might have done so in
      other people&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;for a man who makes himself supremely ridiculous
      makes himself supremely interesting as well, in certain circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The announcement made by Lord Fotheringay had caused him to seem
      ridiculous, though of course Edmund had made no sign to this effect: had
      he made any sign he would not have heard the particulars of Lord
      Fotheringay&rsquo;s latest fiasco, and he was desirous of learning those
      particulars. Having become acquainted with them, however, he found that he
      had had quite enough of his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the course of the afternoon Mr. Airey perceived that, though in his
      eyes there was something ridiculous in the notion of Lord Fotheringay&rsquo;s
      expression of a determination to marry Beatrice Avon, the idea might not
      seem quite so ridiculous to other people&mdash;Miss Avon&rsquo;s father, for
      instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment he had come to the conclusion that the idea might not
      seem altogether absurd to Miss Avon herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young women of twenty&mdash;even when they have been endowed by heaven
      with lustrous eyes (assuming that the lustre of a young woman&rsquo;s eyes is a
      gift from heaven, and not acquired to work the purposes of a very
      different power)&mdash;have been known to entertain without repugnance the
      idea of marrying impecunious peers of fifty-seven; and upon this
      circumstance Edmund pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing on the brink of a cliff at the base of which the great rollers
      were crouching like huge white-maned lions, Mr. Airey reflected as he had
      never previously done, upon the debased condition of modern society, in
      which such incidents are of constant occurrence. But, however deplorable
      such incidents are, he knew perfectly well that there never had existed a
      society in the world where they had not been quite as frequent as they are
      in modern society in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was quite as likely as not that Lord Fotheringay would be able to
      carry out the intention which he had announced to his confidant of the
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Mr. Airey thought of the lustrous eyes of Beatrice Avon,
      recalling the next moment the rheumatic movements of Lord Fotheringay and
      the falling of the scrap of caked powder from his forehead, he felt
      quixotic enough to be equal to the attempt to prevent the realization of
      Lord Fotheringay&rsquo;s intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that the thought occurred to him&mdash;Why should not Harold,
      who was clearly ready to fall in love with the liquid eyes of Beatrice
      Avon, ask her to marry him instead of his father?
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of his consideration of this question was to convince him that
      such an occurrence as it suggested should be averted at all hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the worst enemy that Harold Wynne could have&mdash;the worst enemy
      that the girl could have&mdash;would like to see them married.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be different if the hot-blooded Italian husband were to pursue
      the enemy of his household to the brink of the Atlantic cliffs and then
      push him over the cliffs into the depths of the Atlantic Ocean. But the
      hot-blooded Italian was not yet in sight, and Edmund knew very well that
      so long as Lord Fotheringay lived, Harold was dependent on him for his
      daily bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Harold were to marry Miss Avon, it would lie in his father&rsquo;s power to
      make him a pauper, or, worse, the professional director with the honorary
      prefix of &ldquo;Honourable&rdquo; to his name, dear to the company promoter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the death of Lord Fotheringay Harold would inherit whatever property
      still remained out of the hands of the mortgagees; but Edmund was well
      aware of the longevity of that species of butterfly which is susceptible
      of rheumatic attacks; so that for, perhaps, fifteen years Harold might
      remain dependent upon the good-will of his father for his daily bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      It thus appeared to Mr. Airey that the problem of how to frustrate the
      intentions of Lord Fotheringay, was not an easy one to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew the world too well to entertain for a moment the possibility of
      defeating Lord Fotheringay&rsquo;s avowed purpose by informing either the girl
      or her father of the evil reputation of Lord Fotheringay. The evil deeds
      of a duke have occasionally permitted his wife to obtain a divorce; but
      they have never prevented him from obtaining another wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this Mr. Edmund Airey knew, having lived in the world and observed the
      ways of its inhabitants for several years.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
